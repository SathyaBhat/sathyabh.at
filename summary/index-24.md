### What's been happening

* It's been a year of going to a lot of concerts - and last Saturday, we went to a concert by [The Paper Kites](https://www.youtube.com/@thepaperkitesband). They are an Australian indie/folk rock band that I first heard back in 2016. I was excited to know they were performing in Enmore and it was a great concert.

* We wrapped up the first term of our guitar class. Over the past 8 weeks, we've been learning slowly on different aspects - the technique, the stretches, reading tabs, strumming patterns and this culminated today with a small recording of the class with us performing the chords of "Dreams" by The Cranberries, and the more advanced folks doing the melody for dreams and a couple of more recordings. I look forward to our next term starting in July.

* We have tried many different restaurants, but this week we tried a new cuisine - West African! We wanted to have dinner before The Paper Kites concert and I was looking for good restaurants near Enmore. While searching for options, I found this place that has West African cuisine called "[Little Lagos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t7e6brKRe46GhvC87)". It was a bit expensive, but the food was good. The cuisine was it was quite similar to Indian - we had Jollof Rice (similar to our pulav), Goat Stew, and Fried Plantains that were so similar to Mangalorean Banana Podi, heh.

* I've started working on a small Discord bot that records the food we have ordered in and my goal is to use it to provide a suggestion for food to order, based on the recorded data. It's a nice excuse to improve my Typescript and Serverless skills. It's in decent shape for anyone who wants to get started with a Lambda function with a function URL, so I will make a template repo out of it so it might help others (and me!) in the future. Here's the [Github repo](https://github.com/SathyaBhat/hungrycat) for the same.

* I'll be doing an Ask Me Anything (AMA) [on the developersindia subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1dgchur/join_sathyajith_bhat_author_aws_container_hero/). Come drop by if you have any questions on Cloud, SRE, DevOps, or anything else!

### Music of the Week

Earlier this week The Raghu Dixit Project announced his new song, and I was blown away that he collaborated with BÃ©la Fleck. Give the song [Sakkare Chakori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YcMJXzxG40&list=PL4an4gce7LuPwDKdwmVCpFgVlBkges-fF&pp=iAQB8AUBk) a listen - what's amazing is that the song is also released in [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YcMJXzxG40&list=PL4an4gce7LuPwDKdwmVCpFgVlBkges-fF), [Tamil](https://youtu.be/b24-58a0g-A?si=tX-ZIdFGtKC0iedF), and [Telugu](https://youtu.be/KTl9EoN9R9s?si=8qzFbpLy4VunU74k).

I came across a full symphony orchestra by a Korean group FLASIC, [who have performed close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZA7ARptg0M&list=PL777F6F97DC4ADD07) to two hours of music from Sid Meier's Civilization VI. This is an amazing listen if you want something pleasing to be playing in the background. Props to everyone for a fantastic orchestra - it truly lifted my mood.

### Links of the week

Couple of links:

1. I came across [this repo](https://github.com/johnalanwoods/maintained-modern-unix) which has a collection of modern alternatives to Unix commands. 
2. Karan has a [great blog post](https://mrkaran.dev/posts/gullak/) on how he built his expense tracker using an LLM to generate a JSON representation of plain text and save that to a database. He goes into full details so be sure to give it a read.
