### What's been happening

* I've been meaning to try out a bunch of things that I have been procrastinating upon:
    * [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase)
    * [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
    * [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI)
    
    Writing it here so that I can check these out soon!

* Earlier in the week I'd tweeted about re-discovering [Dave Matthews Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Matthews_Band).

    I used to listen to a lot of Dave Matthews Band during my early days in Chennai, on the office bus when we had an hour long commute. Put on DMB and just watch the world disapper away! My mind somehow was reminded of [Grey Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-jaSbiwWGU) and this just triggered a whole bunch of emotions, nostalgia and how amazing I'd feel listening to them. This past week, I'd been listening to a whole lot of their live concerts, and my favourite has to be this 32-minute masterpiece of a collaboration with [BÃ©la Fleck and the Flecktones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Fleck_and_the_Flecktones) - every instrument is featured in the live piece, and is a supremely amazing piece of live performance. Give it a [listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S828_f0-dQI)

* Published a fight of taking on Scion of the Elves in Divinity: Original Sin II. Much like many of the fights in Divinity, this one's pretty challenging and really forces you to think. I started playing Divinity: Original Sin II in Classic mode difficulty. I found the difficulty spikes to be much too annoying and frustrating and I dropped it down to Explorer. In this difficulty, I think it's a tad bit too easy, but I know moving it back will get me frustrated with the game. Anyway, give [the video a view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTDltHoQbYg).

* Instagram ads are pretty annoying and irrelevant but I have to admit, most of my concert discovery has been via Instagram ads. I found about [Candlelight concerts](https://feverup.com/en/sydney/candlelight) via Instagram ad. They're doing a tribute to Queen in June and I bought tickets for that. Let's see how it goes!

* I switched to Firefox again. I'd been using Edge for the past 4 years or so and wanted to try out Firefox again. Sadly not much has changed, container tabs is still the best feature. Dragging a tab out into a new Window is still clunky and slow. Dragging a tab out to my second monitor doesn't bring it to the second screen. Just a bunch of papercuts, but still annoying.
