Back in 1997, when I was in 7th standard, and an adolescent, I was a huge fan of Duke Nukem 3D - for its AWESOME graphics, the attitude, and of course the sex and the violence ðŸ˜› . Back in those days, I used to play it on my old computer - an Intel Pentium 100MHz, with 16MB RAM, an 8X Creative CDROM drive and a Creative SoundBlaster 16 soundcard and had a blast with its 320.x240 "high-res" graphics!  
  
Coming to the post, while on twitter, somehow the topic of Duke Nukem came, and <a href="https://mallugeek.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimal George</a> pointed me to the The Internet Tablet Talk forums, where a member has actually ported Duke Nukem 3D to the Nokia N800/N810 Internet Tablet. You can find the complete instructions over at the <a href="https://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17315" target="_blank">forums</a>. It's just amazing as to how far technology has progressed that allows you to play what we used to play on a bulky desktop onto a sleek handheld!

For more such games, do check out the <a href="https://www.n800blog.com/category.aspx?id=5&name=N800_Games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N800 blog</a> and <a href="https://pupnik.de/software.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arnim's Ports for Nokia</a>
