We're a week into February. I thought I'll embed a relatively unknown song from one of my favourite bands, [Foo Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters). Give it [a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wG1xEHij08) and let me know on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@Sathyabhat) or comment down below on how you feel about it.

### What's been happening

* Speaking of bands, this week was one of my most anticipated weeks since over 6 months. You see, when I was on [a break between jobs](/2022/06/22/thank-you-adobe) I found out that Red Hot Chili Peppers were to play in Sydney in Feb of 2023. I wasted no time in booking the tickets. Since I can't stand for long, I found that there were tickets for reserved seats were available and I booked the tickets. Well, the concert was this week, on Thursday. Jo and me loved it. 
  * Opening act was by Post Malone, had never heard of him before. Listened to some of his songs before the concert and knew we'd enjoy the whole concert. 
  * The setlist for the Chili Peppers is [here](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/red-hot-chili-peppers/2023/accor-stadium-sydney-australia-3bbd201c.html). They played a fair bit from Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen - which didn't seem to gel well with some of the older crowd. I loved it. People were pretty unhappy with Under the Bridge being omitted. I was hoping to hear Scar Tissue, but they played Snow ðŸ˜Š
  * Our seats were decent and the volume was just right - loud enough to get you into the groove but not loud to cause ear pain. 
  * Stadium was pretty decent, enough options for food and drinks, including beer (I skipped on alcohol though).
  * We got slightly annoyed when trying to enter because our VIP Hot Seat mentioned Gate C, while our tickets said Gate B. Just as we were about to pass through security, the event organizers were like go to the gate mentioned on the ticket, even though at the Hot Seat counter they mentioned otherwise. Thankfully the line wasn't too big at the other gate.
  * I was pretty amazed by the public transportation arrangements. We had dedicated train line with express trains running every 10 minutes. Public transport was free as well since the tickets covered the cost. Not sure if this is common or specific to this concert. The email reminders had mentioned multiple times not to get cars due to lack of parking. We managed to get into the train in about 20 minutes from the time the concert was over. Pretty awesome, I'd say.
