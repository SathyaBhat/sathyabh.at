We're a week into February. I thought I'll embed a relatively unknown song from one of my favourite bands, [Foo Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters). Give it [a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wG1xEHij08) and let me know on [mastodon] or comment down below on how you feel about it.

### What's been happening

* Speaking of bands, this week was one of my most anticipated weeks since over 6 months. You see, when I was on [a break between jobs](/2022/06/22/thank-you-adobe) I found out that Red Hot Chili Peppers were to play in Sydney in Feb of 2023. I wasted no time in booking the tickets. Since I can't stand for long, I found that there were tickets for reserved seats were available and I booked the tickets. Well, the concert was this week, on Thursday. Jo and me loved it. 
  * Opening act was by Post Malone, had never heard of him before. Listened to some of his songs before the concert and knew we'd enjoy the whole concert. 
  * The setlist for the Chili Peppers is [here](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/red-hot-chili-peppers/2023/accor-stadium-sydney-australia-3bbd201c.html). They played a fair bit from Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen - which didn't seem to gel well with some of the older crowd. I loved it. People were pretty unhappy with Under the Bridge being omitted. I was hoping to hear Scar Tissue, but they played Snow ðŸ˜Š
  * Our seats were decent and the volume was just right - loud enough to get you into the groove but not loud to cause ear pain. 
  * Stadium was pretty decent, enough options for food and drinks, including beer (I skipped on alcohol though).
  * We got slightly annoyed when trying to enter because our VIP Hot Seat mentioned Gate C, while our tickets said Gate B. Just as we were about to pass through security, the event organizers were like go to the gate mentioned on the ticket, even though at the Hot Seat counter they mentioned otherwise. Thankfully the line wasn't too big at the other gate.
  * I was pretty amazed by the public transportation arrangements. We had dedicated train line with express trains running every 10 minutes. Public transport was free as well since the tickets covered the cost. Not sure if this is common or specific to this concert. The email reminders had mentioned multiple times not to get cars due to lack of parking. We managed to get into the train in about 20 minutes from the time the concert was over. Pretty awesome, I'd say.
  * Some pics from the concert below!

* The Chinese New Year and the Year of the Rabbit is upon us. Went to Darling Harbour for the fireworks show and there was a lion dance and a dragon dance.

  By the time we were done with these, most of the food places were shutting down so we bought some Japanese Donburi [^1] as takeaway and ate it while sitting in the park benches. Picked up some gelato too and walked back home - Saturday well spent! Check out [the video](https://youtu.be/SuLQbCGJEAo) I made featuring some clips from the Darling Harbour Fireworks and the Lion and Dragon Dances.

* Exciting Sunday night! We were all set to have pizza (Jo was making it). Turned the oven on, some 10 minutes heard a pop and suddenly we were sitting in darkness. Turns out the oven ended up tripping the main circuit breaker. I looked at the breakers in the house, flipped the one that had tripped back to "on" and.... no dice. On a Sunday night, at 10:30 pm. Ended up calling Glenco, who were listed in my rental agreement. About an hour later, the electrician came over. They looked at the house, went over to the electrical cabinet and flipped it on. TIL that the electrician has a key that can open most electrical cabinets, so they don't have to call the building managers. Handy if you get stuck like me.

* Couple of days later, we had the technician come over to check the oven. Turns out the heating coil ended up shorting, which caused the main circuit break to trip off. Thankfully, no damage to any of our equipment. They replaced the coil the same day and the oven is back in action! 

* We had long weekend - Thursday was off due to [Australia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day)[^2]. Thought we'll do some weekend roadtrips but ultimately did nothing.. 

* My Singapore visa application got approved! I have a multi-entry visa valid for two years, when I requested for a week - not complaining.

* I reinstalled GTA V and played a bit with Bibhas. GTA V MP, especially with friends can be really fun, but Rockstar makes it really difficulty to play with only friends, and consistently throws you out into a public session. Too many griefers and hackers causing disruption. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sGNS8u0snQ) for example.

* Jo has started watching a series called [Cold Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Case). It's about couple of Philly detectives that look into cases that have been unsolved for many years/decades, often brought into light due to situations (dying person's confession for ex). It's an interesting take on the crime drama series, and there's lots of flashbacks on what had happened with many of the suspects shown in current as well as past era. Love the soundtrack! Lots of awesome songs. Somebody has compiled a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0iPA7Rac8yaErLd2VscK9Q?si=a8e66d1055da4c2c) of the songs. Go check it out if you like crime/drama series. 

* It's been another weird weather week and I confirm the [Vornado 660](https://vornado.com.au/products/660-large-air-circulator) is really good. There's a clear drop in temperature in the bedroom, where we've currently kept it. We've not needed to use the airconditioner since it does such a good job. 

That's a wrap up. Have a great Febuary!

[^2]: From the wiki: Australia Day marks the 1788 landing of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove and raising of the Union Flag by Arthur Phillip following days of exploration of Port Jackson in New South Wales. In present-day Australia, celebrations aim to reflect the diverse society and landscape of the nation and are marked by community and family events, reflections on Australian history, official community awards and citizenship ceremonies welcoming new members of the Australian community.
