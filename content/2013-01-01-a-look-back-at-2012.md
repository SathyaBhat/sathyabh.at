Last year, I'd written a <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2012/01/06/2011-year-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 year in review</a>, thought that was a nice way to recap the year. Continuing the same trend, here's how 2012 went by

  * Welcomed the New Year in a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat/sets/72157628673244635/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffee estate/homestay in Chikmagalur</a> with Ashwin, Daaku & Prasad.
  * <a href="https://twitter.com/SathyaBhat/statuses/162141168673636352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Made a quick trip</a> to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat/sets/72157629092901365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mumbai & Vasai</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/ashwinsid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashwin</a>Â and finally met some awesome twitter folks - <a href="https://twitter.com/b50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">b50</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Anaggh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anaggh</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nakulshenoy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nakul</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jayesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jayesh</a>,Â <a href="https://twitter.com/slackerninja" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slacker,</a>Â <a href="https://twitter.com/Preshit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preshit</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/failgunner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Failgunner</a>Â and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat/6774123573/in/photostream/lightbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots more</a>.Â <a href="https://twitter.com/mloclam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malcolm</a> welcomed us to Vasai with an epic awesomesauce lunch and a trip around Vasai. Aalaap gets drunkÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/SathyaBhat/statuses/163179346041913344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and results in skipping the Pune/Doolally visit</a> that we had planned
  * Ditched the iPhone again, went back to Android and bought a <a href="https://twitter.com/SathyaBhat/status/186143483101319168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S2</a>
  * <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2012/09/06/reddits-secret-santa-and-guinness-world-record-for-most-email-addresses-in-to-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Became a Guinness World Record holder</a>, albeit with my email leaking out to whole lot of people.
  * Diablo III finally <a href="https://techie-buzz.com/gaming/diablo-3-release-date.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gets released</a>, after a 12-year wait. And I played it. A lot</a>. 
      * Made a trip back to Chikmagalur to the coffee estate/homestay that we had gone to during New Years' - this time during the start of monsoon season. The weather was out of this world.
      * Got a chance to beÂ <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2012/07/03/being-on-the-other-side-of-the-interview-table/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interviewer</a>Â which was<a href="https://twitter.com/SathyaBhat/statuses/160254819653791744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Â pretty cool</a>.
      * Became part of <a href="https://barcampbangalore.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barcamp Bangalore</a> organizing team - though I was more or less handling the word-of-mouth marketing part, it was hell loads of fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/barcampbng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweeted the hell</a> out of it. Gave a small talk on automated data backup too ðŸ™‚
      * Kunti, Bibhas, Rishabh come down to Bangalore. Had great fun meeting up and hanging out with them. Some pics from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4050605901702.233073.1178612288&type=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kunti</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4490326697544.181808.1271537131&type=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bibhas</a>Â & <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.503425129667926.125702.100000013290698&type=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rishabh</a>.
      * As if to take revenge for me dumping the iPhone 3GS, its battery <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2012/10/07/the-case-of-the-expanding-exploding-iphone-3gs-battery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded and exploded wildly</a>.
      * Plan a trip to Pune for NH7 weekender. <a href="https://twitter.com/SathyaBhat/statuses/264696852258119680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ditch Weekender plans</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SathyaBhat/statuses/264696429711355904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meetup with slacker & Mikhail</a> at Hyatt.
