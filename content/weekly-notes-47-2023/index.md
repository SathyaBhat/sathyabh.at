### What's been happening

* An early newsletter this week! I'll be flying to Las Vegas for AWS re:Invent and won't be able to get this one out after tomorrow, so wanted to publish this week's post. Looking forward to meeting a lot of folks! Also excited about [my talk: NET327 Improve web application performance using AWS Global Accelerator](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?search=NET327) on Nov. 28.
* Summer's coming soon, and we're preparing for it. So much so that we bought another [Vornado 660](/2023/01/21/weekly-notes-03-2023/) for the Living Room. We'd already been impressed with it, and with Jo now working remotely from her desk in the living room, buying another was a no-brainer, especially since it has been much more effective (both cost as well as temperature-wise) than running ducted air conditioning.

* I also picked up a [Belkin MagSafe 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand](https://www.belkin.com/au/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/P-WIZ017.html) for my desk. I thought of going for a generic no-brand solution but they coming nearly to the same price as the Belkin ones (at least the two-in-ones anyway) but some more research indicated that determining whether or not they would do fast charging is another headache. I would rather pay some extra and get a solution that will last longer and provide fast charging, so picked up this one.
* Media watch: I completed watching some of the reality shows that I had started watching:
    * [The Amazing Race Australia Season 7: Celebrity Edition](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-amazing-race-australia/seasons/7) - this one was quite surprising. A lot of good competitive teams and great racing around, with some episodes having extremely close calls. The ending kinda ruined it for me (I won't spoil it), but still worth a watch.
    * [The Amazing Race Season 34](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-amazing-race-2001/seasons/34) - I didn't like a lot of changes the season had brought in due to COVID restrictions (specifically, the starting together bit) and most of the teams were quite boring.
    * [Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip](https://trakt.tv/shows/gordon-gino-and-fred-s-road-trip) - I can't remember who recommended this but has been a pretty good watch. Think Grand Tour, but instead of Clarkson/Hammond/May you have Gordon/Gino/Fred. Binge-watching the entire four-season series might be too tiring, so I would recommend watching maybe one or two seasons at a time. 
* Gaming watch: I'm close to finally being level 100 with my Druid in Diablo IV (only 9 more levels to go). I probably should get back to Baldur's Gate 3, that said I might start another character in Diablo IV, given that there's still some time for the season to end.

### Music of the Week

I'm not a big fan of Metal, but Helloween is an exception. One of the most influential power metal bands, I enjoy their ballads, and the sweeping riffs. I came across this [amazing rendition of Forever and One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43OKd48UXIg) with both Andi Deris & Michael Kiske singing the song.

### Link of the week

I came across this series of posts about the development of GTA Vice City. I love the GTA Series (see my previous post on this), and I enjoyed reading the posts. Sadly, the posts were taken down due to his ex-colleagues not liking him spilling the beans. Luckily for us, the Internet Archive still [has the posts](https://web.archive.org/web/20231122005820/https://insiderockstarnorth.blogspot.com/). Go read while it lasts, or save a copy, maybe.
