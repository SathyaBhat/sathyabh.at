Since each service now offers its look back at 2023 / year in review / wrapped, I figured it'd be nice to collect them all in one place, similar to how I did it [last year](https://sathyabh.at/2022/12/31/wrap-up-of-wrap-ups-2022/).

### Music

![Spotify 2023 wrapped](https://i.sathyabh.at/sb/wrapped/2023/spotify.jpg)

No changes here, Modern Rock is still my most listened-to genre. With 642 artists listened to, playing a song more than a couple of times brings it to my top list. I've recorded Spotify's wrapped and published it to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pov0wf9R0R0). Want to listen to my Top Songs 2023 playlist? Find it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1Fa1IIVtEpGUcU?si=35c09ec9f44b4ecb).

Last.fm doesn't provide a list till Jan 1, 2024 - so once that is out, will link here.

### Gaming

Catch the full stats on [Steam's page](https://s.team/y23/dmwmfff?l=english)

Baldur's Gate 3 takes the top place for the most played game, with Vampire Survivors coming close thanks to my binge-playing it on the [Steam Deck](/2023/03/20/weekly-notes-11-2023/). Steam stats however don't capture my Diablo 4 numbers - since battle.net doesn't expose official numbers via their APIs (unlike Diablo 3), I used [D4armory.io](https://d4armory.io/) to arrive at an estimate of about 288 hours. So yeah, a lot of Diablo IV has happened in the second half of the year ðŸ˜‚


### Raycast

I have been using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) as my Spotlight replacement on my work laptop. While I don't use many of Raycast's features, I find the Window management shortcuts for Spectacle to be probably the best use of it, along with some custom scripts I wrote to manage my Jira workflows.

### Untappd

Finally, my beer stats ðŸ˜‚ Since the past couple of years, I've cut down on my drinking quite a bit so there are not a lot of stats here.
