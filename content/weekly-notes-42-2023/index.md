This week's post is massively delayed because I'm on my vacation and I missed my usual writing time.

### What's been happening

* It's been a week of relaxation, and I've done nothing but eat, sleep, visit a few places (staying at my place, visiting my in-laws, and a day-trip with my sister that we did last week), and play some games on the Steam Deck. 
* AWS re:Invent slide submission deadline has come and gone by, we're all set. 
    * Reserved seating for AWS re:Invent also opened up past Tuesday. I've managed to reserve a slot for most of the talks I was interested in, and [my own talk](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?search=NET327) has no free seats. That said, a portion of the seats will be available for walk-in attendees, but expect long lines especially if a talk/topic is in heavy demand.
* After long last, I converted Jo's & my Airtel postpaid numbers to prepaid. We've been meaning to do this since long but on every visit it gets derailed by something else. On the flipside, I am missing my 330 GB per month data allowance on the postpaid - especially back home in Mangalore where we don't have a broadband connection.
* Can't believe a week has gone by so fast. Half my vacation is over! I fly over to Bangalore tonight and will be meeting a few more friends, an office visit and some more eating before I head back to Sydney next Sunday. 

### Music of the Week

TIL, Nyango Star. In case you're wondering I'm linking this [video](https://youtu.be/-UYgORr5Qhg?si%253DlwPJPMblFOFs_kR9), keep watching for at least a minute. Entertainment, guaranteed.

[I'm banned for life from advertising on Meta. Because I teach Python](https://lerner.co.il/2023/10/19/im-banned-for-life-from-advertising-on-meta-because-i-teach-python/) - when automated flagging meets data retention policies, fun things happen.
