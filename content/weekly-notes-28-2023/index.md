### What's been happening

* Having completed Diablo IV campaign [last week](/2023/07/09/weekly-notes-27-2023/), I completed the Altars of Lilith and the Strongholds. Finding the Altars were a bit of a pain but I enjoyed conquering the strongholds. 
    * I look forward to playing the season when it starts this week! Check out this [clip of me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7aF_ZE6Qc) defeating the Nightmare difficulty Capstone Dungeon bass.

* The electricity meter at my premises has been upgraded from a analogue meter to a digital one. Although the meter is in the electricity cabinet that is outside my house, my provider's portal page now gets daily updated cost usage information. It's a shame they don't have a public API yet, I might have to write a script that scrapes this information out. 
* We spent a fair bit of time yesterday doing house inspections in Neutral Bay and Marrickville. We're still looking for our next house, but hey at least I got to eat some South Indian food thanks to the Saravana Bhavan outlet in North Sydney that I spotted while walking around.

* The [Goodwood Festival of Speed](https://www.goodwood.com/tags/?t=FOS%202023&p=1) is back this weekend. Unlike last year, I can't watch it live due the timezone difference but I look forward to watching the highlights from their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GoodwoodRR).
