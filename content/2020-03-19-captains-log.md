Captain's Log: Stardate -303213.11. It's been 35 years since I've been on this planet and the past couple of months leading to the day, and we've been witness to a phenomenon that I've read in history books or simulated on [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_Inc.). A [virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2), has spread through the world so vast that the disease has been deemed as a [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic). Most of the countries have countries have been hit really bad, some [moreso than others](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Quarantines and lockdowns are the norm. [Social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing) is expected upon and most of the events, concerts, festivals are being cancelled. Restaurants are closed, empty and/or are being converted to support only takeaways.
