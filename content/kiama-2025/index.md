A few weeks back, we had a lazy weekend and Jo asked if we could do a day trip somewhere. Last year when Jo's cousins were over, we did a trip to [Bowral](https://sathyabh.at/weekly-notes-13-2024/), and while returning, we drove by Kiama. Unfortunately we were already late and didn't have time to explore the town back then. We decided to make a day trip to Kiama to check out the town.

The trip also gave me a chance to try out the Haval Jolion Pro HEV (and I wasn't too impressed with it - more on another post). Our trip started with us booking the car. I wasn't sure how long we'd take - so we booked the car on GoGet for 8 hours. The Haval Jolion was parked at Crow's Nest, near Moon Phase cafe so we decided to head to the cafe for a quick breakfast, pick up coffee and start driving towards Kiama.

### Moon Phase

I've written about Moon Phase [previously](/weekly-notes-17-2025/) - it's a small little cafe that makes some seriously amazing pastries that are so amazingly crunchy. We picked a pastry each to Eat at the cafe and then a couple of coffees for the road.

The Haval was parked just outside the cafe, so we didn't have to walk far. Seated in the car, I did my usual driver adjustments, Jo started our roadtrip playlist and we started off. Since this was a car I had never driven before, it took me a good half hour or so to get familiar with the acceleration, braking, adjusting the cruise control and other such idiosyncracies of the car.

Once settled in, the rest of the ride to Kiama was smooth and comfortable. We took the M1 motorway path - and that did mean we reached Kiama in about two hours. However, the M1 skips the Grand Pacific Drive and Sea Cliff Bridge - but that's ok, we'll do that route some other time.

### Kiama

We arrived at Kiama around 11:40 am and since the markets were on, decided to head over to the markets. Jo initially input a location that was a bit.. derilict. Not sure what happened there but a quick check and we realized the markets were couple of streets away and we head over there. There wasn't much parking available, so we found a spot closeby and started walking to the market, passing by the Scots Presbyterian Church.

We walked closer towards the Kiama Seaside Markets. The market was buzzing and quite vibrant. There were all sorts of stalls selling souvenirs, artisanal goods and quite a bit of food. We didn't buy anything but it was nice to walk around and see the stalls. From the markets, we walked towards the black beach and sat down there for a while.

From here, we decided to head over to the Kiama Blowhole - arguably, Kiama's most famous and iconic spot. Kiama Blowhole is apparently the largest in the world and shoots up water through the 2.5 metre opening in the rocks to as high as 30 metres. The blowhole has many different viewing points, but I think the best one was the point that's just after the first level of steps. The level that the water plume reaches through the blowhole can vary depending on weather, wind, tide and many more. We didn't have to wait long before seeing the water shoot through and while it wasn't as what we'd seen in some of the pictures, it was nonetheless quite spectacular. After walking around for a bit here, we went over to the Little Blowhole which is less famous but I found it to be a lot more spectacular.

By the time we were done with these sightseeing, it was close to 1:30 and we realized that a lot of the cafes/restaurants were closing at 2pm, so we found a Chinese restaurant near the city center and drove over - parking the car at the first available spot. Walking over to the restaurant, we realized it was a takeaway place and no place to sit, we started looking for other options. I noticed a South African cuisine cafe and curious to try it out, we went over there - KG Cafe.

### KG Cafe

KG Cafe is a South African Cafe serving traditional South African dishes such as Bunny Chow, Bobotie, Boerewors, Great Gatsby, Koeksisters and many more traditional dishes. A lot of the dishes seem to be Indian inspired going by the description of the food. All of them looked really good, so we ordered the South African Tasting Board which had a selection of dishes including the Bunny Chow, Bobotie, Vetkoek and more. The most amazing thing was the chef who came out to deliver the food was a Bangalorean - a Malleshwaram _huduga_ and we spoke a bit in Kannada. The food was really good, and we were so stuffed that we did not end up eating dinner!
