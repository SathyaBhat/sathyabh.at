### What's been happening

* It's been a slow week and on this Easter weekend, we have nothing planned. That said, next week I have [Vinayak](https://twitter.com/vinayakh) coming over to Sydney and have a drive to Blue Mountains planned. Look forward to that visit!

* I have updated the [Photo Gallery](https://pics.sathyabh.at/) page with albums from couple of my visits: [Byron Bay](https://sathyabh.at/2023/01/07/a-look-back-at-2022/) from last year and to [Newcastle](https://sathyabh.at/2023/03/20/weekly-notes-11-2023/) couple of weeks ago. Check out the [Australia](https://pics.sathyabh.at/australia) and [Romania](https://pics.sathyabh.at/romania) pages!

* It was the AWS Summit weekend. While I didn't get to AWS Summit Sydney, but I did drop by for the unofficial Heroes & Community Builders meet arranged by [Stephen Sennett](https://twitter.com/ssennettau) and met up with some awesome folks! Glad I dropped by for the meet. Thanks to [Stephen](https://twitter.com/ssennettau) & [Kris Howard](https://mastodon.social/@web_goddess@aus.social) for the pic!

* I've started looking into the Steam Deck homebrew scene, starting with the [Decky Loader](https://deckbrew.xyz/). Look forward to experimenting with it and write up more. 

### Links of the week

This week I've got three links that I found fascinating:

* [What lesser-known accessories do you use with your computer?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35429801) - Tired with your clickety-clack mech keyboard, shiny RGB lights and still need something to fill up your desk? Give this thread a read.

* [Video Tap – automatically convert YouTube videos to blog posts](https://christianheilmann.com/2023/04/03/review-video-tap-automatically-convert-youtube-videos-to-blog-posts/) - fascinating what AI tools are capable of now, and we're just getting started.

* [What Happened When Uber’s CEO Started Driving for Uber](https://archive.is/EwR5v). Interesting story that sounds more like an episode of Undercover Boss (minus the sob stories). Give it a read on why Uber started changing the behaviour of their app.
