<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">After a loong gap of about 2 and a half years, BarCamp Chennai 2[BCC2] is all set to rock your world!</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If you're wondering what BarCamp is all about [as I was couple of months ago], BarCamp is an "unconference" - a venue where share, volunteer and participate in an open environment. The hallmark of BarCamp is that - there is no audience, all are participants! Participation can mean - giving a talk, demos, volunteering, or even blogging/twittering/podcasting/photography!</span>



<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If that's gotten you all excited, head over to the <a href="https://barcampchennai.org/index.php?title=BCC2_Register" target="_blank">registration page - and enroll yourself</a>. If you want to know what's going on behind the scenes or want to sponsor the event/ take part in behind-the-scenes operation, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/barcampchennai" target="_blank">BarCamp Chennai group</a>.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">BarChennai 2 is scheduled to be held on October 18th & 19th, 2008. The venue is being finalised, I will keep you guys updated.</span>

The recent set of mails being sent over the mailing list has made me lose hope of BarCamp Chennai being a fun event, and is headed towards Geek/ProgrammerCamp/I-Know-Real-BarCamp shit. So while I was speaking to Narayanan, Ashish and Karthik the other day, Narayanan proposed a TweetCamp. Details being sketched out as of now, probably this post will act as a catalyst ðŸ™‚ What do you want to do in TweetCamp?
