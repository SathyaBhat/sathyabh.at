Well there are somethings which I thought I'd never see. Now as I've seen it all(ok, almost all!)

The setting: Yesterday night/today early morning  
The time: 2:00 AM  
The Place: Cristal Guest House, Chennai, the guest house where I stay.

I was sleeping blissfully, having a good night's sleep. Then all of a sudden, I hear a faint buzz. Thought that was just me dreaming. Then, BUZZ again. And then the door starts banging. I was half awake now, cursing the person who might be buzzing the room at this unearthly hour. I open the door, only for finds Cops staring at me ‚ùó At this moment, I was still in a very dazed state, and then seeing cops banging the doors of other rooms I realize that this is no dream!  
Here's the talk I had with the Cop:

Cop: How many people in room?  
Me: 2  
Cop: Let me see (and then he peeks in)  
Cop: What you doing here?  
Me: Working in Chennai  
Cop: Show id card  
Me: Here(and shows him my 3i Infotech ID Card)  
Cop: Ok oK  
Me(tell my Roomie): Arre Adi, show him your id na(my roomie was too sleepy and had no idea what's happening)  
Cop: It's ok  
Then the Cop shifts his focus to other room  
Me: Can we please go back to sleep now??  
Cop: OK OK

I was like whaa&#8230;. :-?? with this whole incident!
