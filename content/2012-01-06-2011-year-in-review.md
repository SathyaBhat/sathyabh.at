2011 was a roller coaster year. Here’s the year in review, in bullet points

  * Sold off my iPhone 3G and purchased a Nexus S
  * Supposed long term US stay [gets cut short][1].
  * 3+ years of work on project gone down the drain. On the upside, learnt quite a lot.
  * Met [Manaa][2] in person, after being a very close friend for 6+ years
  * Was [elected][3] as Community Moderator for one of the Stack Exchange sites, [Super User][4]
  * Wrote my [first Chrome Extension][5] to get around WebNonsense crap
  * Bad security practice [from the past][6] comes to haunt me.
  * [Quit 3i][7] and joined Logica at the middle of the year – after almost having joined TCS, rejected in final round of interview at Oracle & a bungled interview at Société Générale.
  * Did a short term stint [in Bangalore][8] for training at Logica
  * My beloved Nexus S [got stolen][9], purchased a iPhone 3GS from [Shivaranjan][10] as it’s replacement
  * Went on a road trip to Goa with [Appy][11], [AshwinSid][12] and [SwaroopH][13] during the middle of the rainy season.
  * Test drove the Swift & Figo. Waited for the new Swift to arrive in market and then went and booked the Ford Figo. Swift’s price put it out of my budget & couldn’t wait 6+ months for the Swift
  * Met [Harshad Sharma][14] & [Malcolm][15] after having known them for \*years\* on twitter.
  * Gatecrashed [Ravi’s][16] wedding.
  * Ran all over Chennai in trying to get the paperwork & formalities done for the car loan
  * Car loan got disbursed, did the payment, only to be told, couple days before taking delivery that I will be relocated to Bangalore
  * Cancelled car booking, return loan since re-registration of TN car in KA === heavy losses. Total damages: 2.3k(loan processing fees) + 4k (first month interest)
  * Got a [permanent transfer][17] to Bangalore! (woohoo!) [Ashwinsid][12] & [9_6][18] welcome me [in style][19].
  * Moved to a 1BHK house [on rent][20]. Much thanks to [Dkris][21] for allowing me to stay at his house and give expert tips on house hunting.
  * Watched [Poets of the Fall perform with front row, centre stage][22] view at The Great Indian Octoberfest
  * Got [clicked][23] for [#TAD365][24], thanks [Roycin][25]!
  * Met [GeekGod][26] & [Waste-u Photographer][27], [Waste-u Photographer][27]’s [bitch][28] and [Frequent Flyer Manish][29]
  * Finally, welcomed the New Year at a [far-away coffee estate in Chikmagalur][30].
