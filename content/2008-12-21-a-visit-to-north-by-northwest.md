The day I landed in Austin, when I was being driven back, I'd seen this seemingly nice place - North by North West and my colleague told me its a beer brewery and restaurant, and I made a mental note to check it out. Somehow I never checked it out - till today. Yesterday while heading out to Bank of America to encash my Travellers' Cheque I noticed that North by NorthWest is pretty close and walking distance from where I stay, so I decided to check this place out.

Now me being a beer fan there was no way I was gonna miss out on going to this place. Though its mentioned as a "Restaurant and Beer Brewery" its really more of a beer brewery plus bar, they were few tables - it was more of a 'Bar-stool-table' sort of a thing. Its a good place for you to come with your buddies.

The place's got bunch of HDTVs' which would be great for watching the football games which would be on air.

Being a beer brewery they've got some of their own brewed beer - I had couple of Northen Lights - its basically a light beer with a hint of groundnut taste. 't was pretty nice. Also had Chicken Albedo Pasta - which is basically Pasta plus Chicken plus Onions and Red Capsicum. overall food was ok, the service wasn't upto the mark - but then with only 2 bartenders serving you can't expect much.

Anyways if you're a beer lover and in Austin, do drop by North by Northwest. Its at 10010 Capital of TX Hwy N  
Austin, TX 78759.
