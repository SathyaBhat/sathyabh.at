Yeah that's right, twenty freakin' minutes, and this is just a "teaser". The devs claim that FarCry 2 has over 50 square kilometers of open area, over 100 missions, and over 50 hours of gameplay(what's with everything being a multiple of 50, I wonder).

The game looks awesome though, and devs claim that still lot of work needs to be done - which was apparent from the demo, as it crashed mid-way during the demo, and there was lot of tearing and. lagging.

Based on the [Dunia][1] engine,Â  the gameplay demo was pretty awesome - specially the physics.

So, will this be the new Crysis - in terms of hogging system resources that is? Will the question shift from "Will this run Crysis" to "Will this run FarCry2" now ?

Your guess is good as mine.

Till then, [enjoy the video][2]
