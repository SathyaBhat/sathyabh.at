I keep getting this mail as a forward, and it's contents reflect my views too. Have a look at the mail.

Now whether is mail was _really_ sent by [N R Narayan Murthy][1] or not remains a mystery, but this mail makes a lot of sense, irrespective of which field you're working in,  and this situation is more common in our much "revered" software industry.

Of the entire mail forward, the below section really hits the nail on the head as to why you should leave <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on time</span>

Take my office for instance - I have a team mate who regularly used to stay back till 21:30 - 22:00 with the same reason as mentioned above("What to do going home yaar, I'll surf the net or something here"). Now he's facing the consequences of his late-stay, as the Manager has taken for granted that he'll be there no matter what. When I joined the team - the first thing I was told my by other team mates was always leave on time - and I've followed that, except on occasions when things demanded me staying back. Now that team mate of mine complains that he can't go early home - to me that is. He doesn't say a word to the Manager, when the manager asks him to stay late. Of course, the Manager isn't forcing him to stay - he just says, you'll be be there right? And this fellow silently nods his head. Not even one utterance of No. This kinda late stay has become a habit of sorts in our office, and it really irks me when I leave on time at 18:45, people ask  "Leaving early?", to which I politely and strongly shoot back - "No, I'm leaving on time".

So I echo the same sentiment which is reflected in the mail: Leave on time! Don't make it a habit to stay back late to "finish pending work" - it's highly unlikely you'll do that given that you're mentally tired and aren't likely to come up with a solution to your problem. Instead you'll cause inconvenience to others who leave <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on time</span> and yet are seen as "early leavers"
