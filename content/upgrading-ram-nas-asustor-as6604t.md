### Why

### Looking for RAM

### Putting the RAM 

### Cost of purchases

### Summary

Overall, I am quite happy with the Asustor AS6604T NAS and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent 4-bay NAS, assuming you will use it as a NAS and not as a full-blown home server. With a RAM upgrade, the AS6604T can act as a mini home server as well, but the problems I have seen with the ADM OS make me question if it's worth going that route. There are posts on [Reddit on How to install](https://www.reddit.com/r/asustor/comments/t3kh1t/newb_installing_ubuntu_linux_on_asustor_as5304t/) Ubuntu or other Linux distros on the NAS, but it will require a significant time investment. Also, there are plenty of reports of losing fan control if an alternate OS is installed. If you're just looking for backups and a couple of side containers, the AS6604T will do just fine. If you have any questions, please leave a comment or [send me toot on @SathyaBhat@Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@Sathyabhat), I'll be happy to answer.
