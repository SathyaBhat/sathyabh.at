### What's been happening

* I'll be spending my next three weeks in the US, with the first two in Boulder, Colorado, and the last week in San Francisco. I hope to meet some new colleagues and some old friends.
* My Diablo IV playthrough has been coming along pretty nicely. I just finished Act 3 (I believe there are 6 acts in the game). For most of the first act, I spent a lot of time exploring the map rather than going through the campaign, so now I am way over leveled for the act. Diablo IV does level up the enemies (unlike the previous games) to your level in the campaign, so it's not boring as such.
    * While I'm away, I will have my Steam Deck with me. I've tried Diablo IV on the Steam Deck, and it works pretty well. I'm not sure if I will continue with my new Barbarian character or finish the campaign with the first sorcerer. I'm heavily leaning towards playing with the Barb - I want to take copious amounts of screenshots (already have > 500MB worth of screenshots) and watch the cutscenes on the big screen, as it will be quite unlikely that I will play the campaign.
    * Now that I've been playing for over 16 hours, here are some things I don't like about it: tedious fetch-item and escort-person quests, lots of backtracking, and the occasional glitch in the game state (just finished a cellar that was not marked as cleared because the enemies got stuck in limbo. Oh well.)
    * Here are some spoiler-free images from the game:

* There will be more concerts in Sydney - Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe will be performing in November, and Foo Fighters in December. I've got tickets for both and I'm looking forward to hearing them play.
* Our clothes tumble dryer malfunctioned abruptly this week! While it continued to work, there was an obvious burning smell indicating a problem with the thermostat or something that was controlling the temperature in the dryer. We reached out to our real estate agent, who got it replaced.
* I mentioned Reddit's path to [enshittification last week](/2023/06/04/weekly-notes-22-2023/), but this week they, and specifically the [CEO Steve "spez" Huffman](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) seems to [have committed harakiri](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/145crtu/spez_is_a_cunt/). Over [a thousand subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/wiki/index/) are going black from June 12th. [Apollo has decided to shutdown completely](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/), as have many other clients, but it remains to be seen what impact it will have to Reddit as a whole. 
* I did a stats check on my coffee machine, a [Gaggia Magenta Prestige](https://www.gaggia.com.au/product/magenta-prestige/), and it turns out I have made 252 latte macchiatos, 50 espressos, and 50 cappuccinos. Going by Sydney's average price of $5 for a coffee, this means that in about 8 months or so, I've broken even on the costs of my machine. Not bad.
