We're coming in on the year-end. Unfortunately, at the Trade Desk, we don't have a winter shutdown, like what we had at Adobe. Regardless, with many people on leave, hopefully, it'll be a quiet week.

### What's been happening

* Jo will be off for the week, but I will be working (and on-call). Thankfully, our on-call schedule is for work hours only.
* We've been going on walks for the past few days now (weather permitting). Yesterday, we did [South Head Trail](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/south-head-heritage-trail) - a small 1km loop trail. We took the ferry from Circular Quay to Watsons Bay, and from there went walking. Overall, it was a nice walk and the pleasant weather made it easier to do.

    * We also went over to the Christmas Market at Martin Place. There were a bunch of stalls for different things (food, clothing etc). We had some nice food, walked around for a bit, and came back.

* I've been building my Ball Lightning Sorcerer and I think I'm close to finishing it, a lot faster than I thought I would. I face-rolled Ashava solo in World Tier 4 in less than 2 minutes ðŸ˜‚.

    * I'll probably head back to Baldur's Gate 3 and progress further there. Meanwhile, I also picked up [Dorfromantik](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1455840/Dorfromantik/), [Unrailed](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/), and might pick up another game or two (contemplating [Dave the Diver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/) or [Anno 1800](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916440/Anno_1800/)).


### Music of the Week

While not the usual music, Tom BetGeorge does some amazing light shows during various festivals.  Check out the [2023 Christmas Light show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq65KaxVrGk) and this time, it includes a little bit of synchronization with fireworks!

### Link of the week

I am building a certificate validation system at work, and while I was doing my research, I came across this [article](https://blog.bityard.net/articles/2023/December/filling-in-the-gaps-httpstls-certificates) about TLS certificates. I think it's a great read for people who want to understand more about how certificates work.
