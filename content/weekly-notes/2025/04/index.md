### What's been happening

I'm almost back in 100% work mode.. almost because

a. There's a long weekend coming up as we have [Australia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day) holiday here on Monday
b. A few folks in office are out post [Palooza](/tags/palooza/) due to "Palooza Plague".

With that said, I've been working on charting out my team's roadmap for the year with my fellow leads and product manager. It will be interesting to see how it goes. It's also performance review season, so I've been occupied this week collecting data about what I did and writing a one-page document about it, and also providing feedback to my peers (anyone in the company can request for peer feedback, and that feedback goes directly to the requesting person's manager).

We have a long weekend coming up, we didn't plan for it for it so no weekend road trip for us. Maybe we'll do something it in the city, or just relax it out at home.

I'm also back to my gym and given there's no holidays or work travel, I'm excited to be back at it and build some consistency. When I joined BBB, they asked me what my target weight was: I had given three numbers: an immediate short term goal, an aspirational goal and a long term ideal goal. I hit my immediate goal a few weeks ago and have been maintaining being under that target weight, despite the travels and what not and as of this week I'm _very_ close to the aspirational goal. I'm quite happy as to how it's coming along - there were many weeks where my weight would remain steady despite the workouts and what not and not seeing the drop was slightly frustrating. Big shout out to my trainer for keeping me motivated and getting my workouts designed just right so that I'm pushing myself but not dreading it.
