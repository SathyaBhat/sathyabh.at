### What's been happening

It's been good progress at some since [last week](/weekly-notes-01-2025/). My father-in-law is now back at home and is doing well. A full recovery is still quite some time away but for now happy to see he's back home and walking about. With that, my mind was more at ease and decided to proceed with heading to Denver for The Trade Desk Palooza. Palooza is an annual, all-company event and is an excellent place to meet a lot of people who we've only interacted over Slack/Zoom as well as to meet team mates from across the geo. I will be flying to Denver via Houston as my layover airport. I'm looking forward to catching up with a lot of people, though I must admit not looking to be in Denver in winter. That said, hopefully being in indoors most of the time and layers will help in keeping myself warm.

This week also marked a return to my PT sessions at BBB Gym. We started a bit lower on the first session but the second session was pretty intense, compared to what I've been doing. Since I will be away the next week, he's asked me to get my steps in. Will be challenging at Denver's altitude and weather but let's see what we can do.

This week I met a former colleague from Adobe Romania! She was spending her Christmas vacations here in Australia and pinged me if I could meet. Luckily, the week that she was free to meet was this week and that worked well for me to meet her. We talked for couple of hours about different things - her vacations, things back in Romania etc. I had a good time. Unfortunately for her, the week that she was vacationing in Sydney is also the week of the some of the gloomiest weather over in Sydney with heavy rains for the past few days. Thankfully, Sydney was not her only destination and she had good weather over at the other places she was at.

With me back in Sydney, I picked up Path of Exile 2 where I left off - towards the end of the Act 2. Act 2 is significantly more difficult - while most of the bosses were manageable, the final Act 2 boss is an absolute pain. I must have died at least 10 times trying to kill it. I'm all for tough fights - but this was ridiculous. The boss has a ginormous number of hitpoints and takes so long to whittle him down, while having to dodge increasingly high number of unavoidable damage hits and one-shot mechanics. Because the health pool is so large, it took a really long time for me to try each attempt and I had several times where I was about one or two hits away from defeating, but died due to the unavoidable damage hits. Here's couple of boss fight videos.

Jo wanted to give another try at getting back to blogging (weekly notes or not remains to be seen) and asked me for suggestions for blogging software, with the constraint that the solution must support custom domain. While I use Hugo and neovim to write these posts (and use the RSS import into Substack, for the newsletter), it's a fairly cumbersome process - especially since I don't like stuffing images into git and have a rather elaborate process to select, download the pictures, resize and convert to jpeg and then upload to S3, and then finally add references to the images. For her goal of easy writing, I think my workflow will be too much of a headache, so we signed up for a [Ghost account](https://ghost.org/) for her to give it a try and I will probably self-host ghost for her if she likes it. Meanwhile, go check out [Jo's Blog](https://blog.joshenoy.me/) and subscribe to it!

Finally, I took some time today to properly catalogue all the vinyls we collected over the year and enter them into Discogs. I was searching for a nice way to create a collage of the album art and found out [DisCovers](https://discovers.antisound.net/) as a simple, fast and easy way to do that. On Mastodon, I was made aware of Waxlog - another awesome way to display [my Discogs collection](https://www.waxlog.com/collection/josathya)

### Music of the Week

### Link of the week

[AWS Hero Renato Losio](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/renato-losio/) picks up inspiration from Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 days and [tries to find how long](https://cloudiamo.com/2024/12/15/around-the-world-in-15-buckets/) it would take a file to circumnavigate the globe through AWS data centers. Fun read!

### Thanks for reading.
