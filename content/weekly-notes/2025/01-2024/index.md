### What's been happening

Welcome to 2025! Hope you folks had a good new year celebration. It's been a patient week for us. Since landing in Mangalore [last week](/weekly-notes-52-2024/), Jo's dad condition has improved quite a bit. Jo and her mother would stay evening/overnight at the hospital, while her sister & brother-in-law would cover most of the day time.

I assumed the driver duties of picking up Jo's mom/her from the hospital, drive them back to the house and then later drop them back at the hospital again. Last checked, I crossed about 190kms of driving. A drive to the hospital trip, pick up and return to home is about 5kms. So yeah, a fair bit of city driving in the past two weeks. The traffic wasn't too bad - exceptions being Friday afternoon at Aloysious Hill (due the presence of Mosque and Friday prayers - the traffic was heavier than usual) and Saturday afternoon/evening were quite significantly heavy. Before we left Mangalore, I went to over to my sister's house to meet her and my niece for a short time.

We head back to Sydney this weekend. Usually, I book the Indigo flight from Mangalore to Bangalore and the Qantas flight from Bangalore to Sydney as two separate tickets. Last time when I was in Bangalore I realized Qantas/Indigo are codeshare partners and that I could book a single PNR ticket from Mangalore to Sydney - this saves us from having to handle the baggage ourselves after landing in Bangalore. We'll be reaching Sydney Monday mid-morning and I've already got my PT booked for Monday afternoon.

I thought I'd retain my weight or worse, put on more weight but it seems like the PT effects lingered on and I lost couple of kilos more (whether that is the effect of stress remains to be seen, heh).

While our holiday went in a way that we least expected, it's good to see Jo's dad getting better. I am supposed to be heading to Denver, Colorado next week for [Palooza](/weekly-notes-05-2024/) but I'm still debating about it.

### What I ate

Usually, Mangalore visit for me at least is a lot of home cooked meals but this time, since I was staying at my in-laws' place, we went to a few different places for breakfast and lunch.

Here are the places we visited:

- New Taj Mahal Cafe

### Music of the Week

David Bowie's Lets Dance is an iconic song from 1983, but I had no idea the music video was shot in Australia (you can see many familar sights of Sydney/Blue Mountains and around) and is a commentary on the treatment of [Aborginal Australians](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Dance_(David_Bowie_song)#Music_video>).

### Link of the week

Jason Cammisa from [Hagerty](https://youtu.be/YffShJxkUyU?si=lhTqux27ZOHaEQV8) has a fabulous video covering a drag race comparison of many cars. What caught my eye was the visuals and the cinematography of the entire video - incredibly well done that hooks you into the content even more.
