### What's been happening

Welcome to 2025! Hope you folks had a good new year celebration. It's been a patient week for us. Since landing in Mangalore [last week](/weekly-notes-52-2024/), Jo's dad had been moved to the ward and has been getting better slowly. Jo and her mother would stay evening/overnight at the hospital, while her sister & brother-in-law would cover most of the day time. I assumed the driver duties of picking up Jo's mom/her from the hospital, drive them back to the house and then later drop them back at the hospital again. Last checked, I crossed about 190kms of driving, while a hospital trip, drop and return to home is about 5kms. So yeah, a fair bit of city driving. Most of the times, the traffic wasn't too bad - exceptions being Friday afternoon at Aloysious Hill (due the presence of Mosque and Friday prayers - the traffic was heavier than usual) and Saturday afternoon/evening were quite significantly heavy. Before we left Mangalore, I went to over to my sister's house to meet her and my niece for a short time.

We will, however, be heading back to Sydney this weekend. I am supposed to be heading to Denver, Colorado next week for [Palooza](/weekly-notes-05-2024/) but I'm still debating about it.

### Music of the Week

David Bowie's Lets Dance is an iconic song from 1983, but I had no idea the music video was shot in Australia (you can see many familar sights of Sydney/Blue Mountains and around) and is a commentary on the treatment of [Aborginal Australians](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Dance_(David_Bowie_song)#Music_video>).

### Link of the week

Jason Cammisa from [Hagerty](https://youtu.be/YffShJxkUyU?si=lhTqux27ZOHaEQV8) has a fabulous video covering a drag race comparison of many cars. What caught my eye was the visuals and the cinematography of the entire video - incredibly well done that hooks you into the content even more.
