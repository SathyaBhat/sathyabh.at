### What's been happening

Ah, it's been a busy week! I missed writing last week's update, so here's a combined update.

* I spent my last week in Boulder. I chickened out of a Barenaked Ladies concert at the Red Rocks due to the hailstorm that I witnessed. Coupled with my jet lag, I wasn't in the right frame of mind to attend the concert. I feel bad about losing the money, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it.
    * On a related note, at a concert at the Red Rocks a week later, over a hundred people were [injured due to sudden hail](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/22/weather/red-rocks-hail-louis-tomlinson-concert/index.html). 
* My flight to SF was delayed by 30 minutes. I've experienced my fair share of flight delays, but this is the first time I've encountered a delay due to changing a tire on the plane. Whew, quite a doozy. The actual flight was pretty smooth, no problems here!
* It's been a busy week in SF, and I've been meeting a lot of people. Visiting the Bay Area for the first time since 2019 (wow!), and I definitely wanted to meet and catch up with a few people before I left. I met the following individuals:
    * Sharif: Sharif joined our team as an intern and later became a full-time employee while I was at Adobe.
    * From there, I attended a small AWS Heroes meet organized by Taylor. It was great to meet Chris Miller, John Vargese, Partha, and of course, Taylor.
    * Dhruva aka Dkris: Dkris was kind enough to let me stay at his house for the first few weeks when I moved to Bangalore more than a decade ago.
    * Rachana and Ishan: Jo's sister and her husband.
    * Nithin 'Bondi' Jois: He's building his cybersecurity startup.
    * Razvan & Diana: Razvan is a friend, mentor, and my former manager at Adobe.
    * Santhosh 'neo_natasha': Former moderator at Chip forums and a good friend from long before..

    As you can imagine, I was meeting a person or a group every day, and although I couldn't meet a couple of folks, I hope to be back soon.

* I went with my work colleagues to Sotto Mare and had some cioppino[^1]. This was the first time I had heard of cioppino, and it was amazing. We ordered the Crab Cioppino (named the 'Best Damn Crab Cioppino' - a well-deserved name, I should add), the Whole Crab Diavolo, and the Grilled Rex Sole. The four of us devoured it all.

* As I write this post, it's July 1 and that means Reddit's deadline for free API usage has expired. [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/), [Bacon Reader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/14egq61/baconreader_november_11_2011_june_30_2023/), [Reddit Sync](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsync/comments/144jp3w/sync_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023/), and many other clients have shut down. Many subreddits went dark but as [I had mentioned](/2023/06/10/weekly-notes-23-2023/), most have returned. Federated sites such as [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) & [Kbin](https://kbin.pub/en) are on the rise but still have content nowhere close to Reddit. I'll keep an eye on these and see how they will fare.

* Meanwhile, Twitter's Brilliant Ideas(tm) continues, this time with Elon applying rate limits to prevent "scrapers" and "AI companies" from "stealing" data. Oh where have [I heard of that](https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html) before, I wonder? Funniest was that this rate late limiting resulted in [legit users](https://fediscience.org/@astromateusz/110640284487277951) being [locked out](https://mastodon.social/@sysop408@sfba.social/110639436283129914). You can't make this shit up!

* Anyway after about 3 weeks on the road, finally glad to be heading back to Sydney. I really enjoyed staying at Boulder. SF, however, not so much. Will be good to back on my own comfy bed!
