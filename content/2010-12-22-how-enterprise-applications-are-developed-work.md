You didn't know what to do with yourself so you sat there all day refreshing a view on the database to spy on what they were doing. Answer: not much. The things they did do, they did wrong. **They found bugs.** They found ways to circumvent all of your carefully constructed system rules and validations. **Not because they were master hackers or brilliant technicians&#8230;but because they were just stupid.** They clicked on things they shouldn't click on. They typed things in that they shouldn't type in. They didn't read simple instructions. **They didn't listen in training. They were personally insulting you by being terrible at using your software.**
