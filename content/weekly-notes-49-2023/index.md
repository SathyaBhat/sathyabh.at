### What's been happening

I was most excited about this week. However it didn't start well

* Monday afternoon or so, I wasn't feeling too well. I had a bit of a fever, a bad headache, and a sore throat. The headache was bad enough that I stopped working and took a nap. I woke up a few hours later - the fever had subsided, but the sore throat remained. I was wondering if I had picked up Covid like last year. I had a light dinner and went to sleep.
    * The next day I woke up and I was feeling much better. We had a concert on Wednesday and Saturday and wanted to do a COVID test for myself, just to be sure. Thankfully the COVID test came negative.
* On Wednesday, we went to a concert by Kraftwerk. Kraftwerk is a German electronic band and is widely considered an innovator and pioneer of electronic music. Growing up as a kid, I had heard Kraftwerk's The Man Machine album quite a lot as Dad had the Man Machine cassette (remember those?) and had heard the songs quite a lot. When I found out they were coming to Sydney, I had to attend the show. In the end, the show was really good - they played most of their hits, including my favorites from The Man Machine, and a few more that I wasn't aware of. All in all, with fantastic lighting, and minimal set design - it was a memorable evening.

* This Saturday was the hottest day of the year with temperatures hitting 41 degrees. It was also one of the days I had been looking forward to for quite some time - Foo Fighters were performing at the Accor stadium. The heat made it difficult, but once the sun went away combined with a [southerly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southerly_Buster) buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southerly_Buster), the temperature dropped down to the low 30s and made it tolerable as the evening went by. Foo Fighters were awesome. Arguably, the [Red Hot Chili Peppers concert](/2023/02/04/red-hot-chili-peppers-post-malone-sydney-2023) had the better sound setup, but the Foo Fighters had better crowd interaction and the crowd was a lot more responsive. Personally, for me, this has been the best live event that I've been to, yet. Here's the [setlist for the concert](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/foo-fighters/2023/accor-stadium-sydney-australia-bae353a.html).

### Link of the week

Ken Block died earlier in the year. Like many, I'd known of Ken Block via his [Gymkhana](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhU72li4fhIfBIHMHSa5ZtjGCplUazKlu) series of videos which dazzled me with phenomenal car control. Hoonigan Media released the last project they were working on, just before this death. [Check out Electrikhana 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4FAqwkn-pc).
