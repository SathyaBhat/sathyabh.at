Well, [Kiruba][1] decided to organise a Chennai Twitter Meetup. As the Wiki states,

> It's really an excuse to have an informal get-together and some fun. A reason for us to get away from keyboards and make new friends in meatspace.
> 
> We go dutch. Get your wallet along!
> 
> Need directions? Call Kiruba at 98415 97744
> 
> Help tweet the news or slap the badge on your blog.

If you're a twitterer in Chennai and would like to be part of the meetup then head over to the [Tweetup Wiki][2] and fill in the details. As much as I'd like to attend the tweetup(my first ever, I might add)Â  I will be at home in Mangalore and hence won't be ableto attend tweetup. Hope the guys would tweet about it.

Cheers guys and have a good time
