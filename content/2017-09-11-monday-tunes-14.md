Monday tunes is here again. Let me know how you like the songs! &#x1f3b6;&#x1f3b5;

<!--more-->

"Goodnight" by Shoffy - this is probably the first song that I really like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2bWoRWc3AD9Dv2IZTa6MaN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the version on Spotify</a>(which I suspect is the orignal) but YouTube doesn't have this one. I'm going to link another one for YouTube but if you can - do listen to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2bWoRWc3AD9Dv2IZTa6MaN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one on Spotify</a>



"Can't Let Go" by VALNTN (feat. Emilia Ali)



"Kiss Fight" by Tülpa ft. gnash & Blankts



"Two Thousand And Seventeen" by Four Tet



To wrap up for this week, "Ghost" by Sir Sly
