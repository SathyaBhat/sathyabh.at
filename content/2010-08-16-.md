Just got this fraudulent email from a so-called "Indian Banks Association"

The email starts off with a not about money laundering and then asks the user to update the banking details failing which "you left us with no choice but to take strict actions against you. Which can bring you to court, we advise you to act as soon as possible so that you do not run into any inconveniences."

Good way to scare the user. Looking at the email, I knew the email was very wrong, so I examined the element of the link to ICICI Bank. And bingo -

A link to a site which is totally not related to ICICI bank, at all. Just to satiate my curiosity, went ahead and clicked the link.

Remember: Any bank will never, ever ask you to "verify" your password, all by itself. Here we have the page asking for your user id, password, Debit card number and transaction password. Curious to see what lies ahead, I went ahead and populated with dummy values

No validations whatsoever (expected). Clicking on Login pages takes me to another page, where it asks for ALL my personal details.

Just reported the site for phishing over at https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/

If any of you get such a mail, use Gmail's report spam feature so that it gets flagged as spam. And remember, Remember: Any bank will never, ever ask you to "verify" or enter confidential details such as the Debit card PIN code, CVV number et al.

Be safe.
