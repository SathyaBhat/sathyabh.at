### What's been happening

* I used to be a huge newspaper buff. As a kid, I would read The Hindu, or Times pretty much cover to cover. Nowadays with my attention span I find it hard to read anything. I’m trying this experiment to read a newspaper. I’ve subscribed to [Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/), which gives me a weekend paper delivery. The subscription also gives me access to a digital scan of the daily papers and crossword and sudoku puzzles :D
* The new season of Wheel of Time is out, and Jo and I have been watching it. So far, the first few episodes have been pretty slow to start, with the pace picking up in the past two episodes. With 5 or 6 different storylines, it's a bit confusing at times but they seem to be converging pretty decently. Hopefully, the pace for the next few episodes will be much faster.
* Diablo 3 Season
