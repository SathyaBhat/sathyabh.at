_Thumbnail image: [The Downing Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Centre) is a major heritage-listed former department store and now courthouse complex in Sydney CBD. The building was originally called the [Mark Foy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foy%27s) Piazza Store, a department store founded by Francis and Mark Foy in 1885._

### What's been happening

* I used to be a huge newspaper buff. As a kid, I would read The Hindu, or Times pretty much cover to cover. Nowadays with my attention span I find it hard to read anything. I’m trying this experiment to read a newspaper. I’ve subscribed to [Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/), which gives me a weekend paper delivery. The subscription also gives me access to a digital scan of the daily papers and crossword and sudoku puzzles :D

* The new season of Wheel of Time is out, and Jo and I have been watching it. So far, the first few episodes have been pretty slow to start, with the pace picking up in the past two episodes. With 5 or 6 different storylines, it's a bit confusing at times but they seem to be converging pretty decently. Hopefully, the pace for the next few episodes will be much faster.
* The new season of Diablo 3 has started. This season has some interesting changes (cap to the paragon points being the most prominent). I've started the new season with a Necromancer, I plan to create a new Witch Doctor at least.
* Jo & I did a sunset harbour cruise, redeeming the Blueboard experience from my first year milestone reward. Check out my [blog post of this experience](/2023/09/17/captain-cook-sydney-harbour-sunset-dinner-cruise).

### Music of the Week

Every now and then, YouTube pops up a recommendation out of nowhere and it makes me wonder, why did I not know about this!?. One such recommendation was [Martin Miller](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKrWgJg6GU9OwC-5fSqfB1g) Session Band's [Ultimate 80's medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4U4b1CJAPg&list=PLHMXDT3DkTcWm1v3YJspMgVnBunpriODg&index=1&pp=iAQB8AUB). The band is so good, and the performance is really awesome. I have been listening to every single medley they've done, and they are just amazing. They capture the sounds, the songs, the little nuances of different bands and ages so well, I would highly recommend giving them a listen.

### Link of the week

Jo told me there's a train from Sydney to Perth. That's a distance about about 4,400 kms. Fascinated, I searched about it and found out about [The Indian Pacific](https://www.journeybeyondrail.com.au/indian-pacific/) which comes with 3-night 4-day package including off-train experiences. This [vlog from Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r1-M5lnSyo) is a wonderful narration of the experience.
