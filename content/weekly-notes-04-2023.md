A month of 2023 is over! Can't believe - time goes by so fast!

### What's been happening

* The Chinese New Year and the Year of the Rabbit is upon us! Went to Darling Harbour for the fireworks show and there was a lion dance and a dragon dance! By the time we were done with these, most of the food places were shutting down, so we bought some Japanese Donburi [^1] as takeaway and had it sitting the park. Picked up some gelato too and walked back home - Saturday well spent!
