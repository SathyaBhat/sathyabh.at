A month of 2023 is over! Can't believe - time goes by so fast!

### What's been happening

* The Chinese New Year and the Year of the Rabbit is upon us! Went to Darling Harbour for the fireworks show and there was a lion dance and a dragon dance! By the time we were done with these, most of the food places were shutting down, so we bought some Japanese Donburi [^1] as takeaway and had it sitting the park. Picked up some gelato too and walked back home - Saturday well spent!

* Exciting Sunday night! We were all set to have pizza (Jo was making it). Turned the oven on, some 10 minutes heard a pop and suddenly we were sitting in darkness.Turns out the oven ended up tripping the main circuit breaker. I looked at the breakers in the house, flipped the one that had tripped back to "on" and.... no dice. On a Sunday night, at 10:30 pm. Ended up calling Glenco, who were listed in my rental agreement. About an hour later, the electrician came over, looked at the house, went over to the electrical cabinet and flipped it on. TIL that the electrician has a key that can open most electrical cabinets, so they don't have to call the building managers. Handy if you get stuck like me.

* Long weekend - Thursday was off due to [Australia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day).
    > (Australia Day) marks the 1788 landing of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove and raising of the Union Flag by Arthur Phillip following days of exploration of Port Jackson in New South Wales. In present-day Australia, celebrations aim to reflect the diverse society and landscape of the nation and are marked by community and family events, reflections on Australian history, official community awards and citizenship ceremonies welcoming new members of the Australian community.
