Since each service now offers their own look back at 2022 / year in review / wrapped, I figured it'd be nice to collect them all in one place. 

### Spotify

Rock is still the most listened to genre. However, I seem to have lost an affinity for artists and just have music running in the background, not paying much attention to the artist/song.

### Steam

No surprises there, Civilization 6 has become my defacto "chill" game since it doesn't require a lot of story involvement and picking up where I left off is relatively easy. 

### Nintendo Switch 

I used the Switch heavily during June & July when I didn't have my PC because of the move from Bucharest to Sydney. Stardew was easy to pickup and leave, and I went into the third year of my farm and getting Grandpa's score.
