We're on double digits! Let me know how you like the songs! &#x1f3b6;&#x1f3b5;

Start with "Stay in" by JAWS. Released in 2012, the song has a very 90s feel



Next is "Flightless (Jody Wisternoff & James Grant Remix)" by Kyson. First heard on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/anjunadeep" target="_blank">Anjunadeep</a> the song is a wonderful piece just right to relax



"Drop" by Lycoriscoris - Another great track I'd heard on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/anjunadeep" target="_blank">Anjunadeep</a>.



Up next, "We Went" by Randy Houser - Action packed video which matches the lyrics very well!



To wrap up for this week, "Woman Woman" by AWOLNATION. I promise I didn't see the video when I had selected this song!
