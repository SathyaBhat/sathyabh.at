If you’ve been following Blizzard’s mysterious splash screens for the past several days, then you must have known that Blizzard is upto their sneaky best, updating a splash-screen on a daily basis, teasing the fans. There were several speculations as to what the splash screen could be: a new series, World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, Starcraft 2 or even Diablo III. After 5 days of torture and tease here’s the final splash:

![Diablo III Splash][1] 



YEAH BABY!!! I'm SUUUUUPER excited, I've been a huge fan of Diablo, Diablo II in particular since I've only played the demo of Diablo. Diablo II had me addicted to it for like 3 years - my friend picked up the original, he didn't like it.I gave it a try and was INSTANTLY addicted to it.

So what will Diablo 3 be like? What will be the camera? Same isometric perspective as that of Diablo II or something different? Multiplayer: Will it be based on Battle.Net, Free or like WoW? When will it be out? What will the system requirements? Oooh so many questions!

Check out Blizzard's [Diablo 3][2] page for some gameplay videos and here's a [Cinematic Trailer][3] of it.

Update: Kotaku has a _19-minute_ gameplay video, the trailer and artwork clip.  
Check it out [here][4]
