Since I've gotten my <a href="https://sathyasays.com/2007/12/02/dell-inspiron-1520-review/" target="_blank">Dell Inspiron 1520</a> & a <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2008/03/02/my-new-baby/" target="_blank">Sony Ericsson</a> <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2008/03/30/sony-ericsson-p1i-review/" target="_blank">P1i</a>, it's been a mess of wires everywhere in my room - the data cable, different set of earphones for my laptop and the P1i - bsaically wires, wires everywhere and all messy, tangled up. I got really frustrated by this and started searching for an alternative. SInce BOTH my laptop and P1i supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth" target="_blank">Bluetooth</a> and [A2DP][1] I thought why not get a Bluetooth headset? After scoping the net for a bit, I was rather confused as to which one to go for. I had a talk over IM with Suri, a good friend of mine from tech2.0 forums and he suggested me a [Sony Ericsson HBH DS-970][2]. After going through few reviews of it, decided to purchase it. Ordered it via Times shopping on Monday, and voila! 3 days later it's here!

Here are some pics:

As from the pic, it looks like a pendrive! Few of my colleagues asked me - How much capacity pen drive is it? Heh! Well I'll review it soon, once I've used it for couple of days.

Wireless Freedom, here I come! And oh yeah, before I forget, it cost me Rs 3900, shipping was free.
