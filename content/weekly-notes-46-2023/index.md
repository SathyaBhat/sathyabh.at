### What's been happening

* Jo has been bitten by the Lightroom bug. She's been taking a lot of photos and editing them in Lightroom, totally transforming the images. I remembered that Adobe Portfolio can set up amazing gallery websites powered by Lightroom Albums (here's [mine](https://pics.sathyabh.at/)) and thus we bought [joshenoy.me](https://joshenoy.me) and set up Adobe Portfolio. Check out [her site](https://joshenoy.me)!
* I did a thing! Well most of the hardwork was done by AWS. Earlier this week, AWS [launched](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/build-ai-apps-with-partyrock-and-amazon-bedrock/) PartyRock, an Amazon Bedrock Playground. PartyRock is a shareable generative AI app building playground that's pretty cool to play around, and for a limited time, has a free trial. I experimented with music and built Sathya's Song-O-Matic for music discovery. Enter an artist or song title to find related artists and songs. Play with it over at [my PartyRock app](https://partyrock.aws/u/sathyabhat/mojOlyjru/Sathya's-Song-O-Matic/snapshot/Rtkh5Hhbi).
* Jo was keen on attending a [Wassily Kandinsky](https://www.theartstory.org/artist/kandinsky-wassily/) exhibit and thus we went over to [the Art Gallery of NSW](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/kandinsky/), spending our Saturday morning there.

* After the Kandinsky exhibit, the entry to the [Royal Botanic Garden](https://www.botanicgardens.org.au/) was just opposite the Art Gallery so we walked over there and spent a couple of hours. It was quite nice, though we had a fair number of [bin chickens](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2018/apr/09/bin-chickens-grotesque-glory-urban-ibis-in-pictures) and [Silver Gulls](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/birds/silver-gull/) cackling at us.

* I fly out to Las Vegas for AWS re:Invent next week. I wanted to get my Covid booster shot before I left (I got [get my first Covid](/2022/12/21/recovering-from-covid) at last year's re: Invent). I got my shot yesterday, and while I didn't feel any ill effects yesterday, today was a completely different story. My arm was sore, I had a 100-degree fever and a massive headache. For now, my fever has subsided and my arm is not that sore, but the headache remains. Hopefully, I will recover before Tuesday morning - because I have my third dry run [for my talk](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7131054434247196674/) on Tuesday.

### Music of the Week

Martin Miller teams up with Mateus Asato for another killer performance. [Go check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYp0JE1qzms&list=PL777F6F97DC4ADD07&index=2).

### Link of the week

I think it's fair to say in between today's World Cup final between India & Australia, [Sam Altman, OpenAI's now-former-CEO ouster](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23966446/what-happened-to-sam-altman-open-ai) and potential [return](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo), and the [successful race](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.verstappen-says-charge-through-the-field-for-las-vegas-gp-win-was-a-lot-of.1YqadyJh8HnZwqrJPdIhnW.html) yet [painful](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fp1-first-practice-session-in-las-vegas-brought-to-early-end-amid-red-flags.2jBEl8KmbU9FowFZCXMV4p.html) and [rocky](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fp2-for-the-las-vegas-grand-prix-delayed.3TRumjKL6LssR9rUJUiwPq.html) start of the Vegas Grand Prix, pretty much everything has been overshadowed by these.
