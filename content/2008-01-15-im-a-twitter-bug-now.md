[Preshit][1] had introduced me to [twitter][2] a while ago, but I'd never bothered to check it(don't ask me why). Seeing twitter updates on Preshit's blog, I thought I'd give it a try. After trying it out, I'm cursong myself — for not having tried it earlier!

In case you guys are wondering, twitter uses the concept of microblogging, where you send short updates of upto 140 characters(or "tweets") to Twitter's [website][2], via SMS, using IM(only Jabber-based protocols like GTalk are supported at the moment). The updates are displayed instantly.  
Believe me, you you start using it, you'll get hooked on to it immediately. And you dont even have to logon to their site, you can update the status using Snitter (which uses Adobe's [AIR][3] technology). FireFox users can also use the [TwitterFox][4] add-on. There's even a KDETwitter plasmoid for those using KDE4.0 Although I've been using only for the past couple of days, I admit, I'm a twitterbug now and totally hooked onto twitter-keep updating status via GTalk, Snitter, KDETwitter, and even using my Cell Phone(though not through SMS as of yet), via GPRS. Highly recommend you guys to try it out! You'll like it!
