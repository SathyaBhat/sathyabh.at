### What's been happening

* I wrote up about my current gaming setup - check out the full [post](/2023/05/23/hellforge-down-under/). I also added aliases to [/setup](/setup) and [/hellforge](/hellforge) that points to that post. Hugo's aliases are a nice feature!
* One of my favorite Twitch streamers, Hitch, is back on his streams, and this time he’s doing a cycling trip across Europe to [TwitchCon](https://www.twitchcon.com/en/paris-2023/) with a [trailer that has a solar panel](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/552728538353106944/1107314089727893614/20230514_163006.jpg) to power his devices! Pretty cool - give [Hitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hitch) a view. He's pretty nice to chat with and is responsive.
* I gave a talk about AWS Networking for beginners for an online meetup. I've published the [slides on my site](https://slides.sathyasays.com/aws-networking/).
* [Vivid Sydney](https://www.vividsydney.com/) is an annual festival of light, music and ideas held here in Sydney. It started this week, and there are a lot of light installations, pieces, and more primarily around Circular Quay, the Opera House, and a few more locations. We went over there for a concert as part of Vivid Sydney, and it was amazing to see the Harbour Bridge and Circular Quay lit up, with the Opera House being used as a canvas.

* Speaking of concerts - this one was much-awaited. Jo and I went to see [José González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Gonz%C3%A1lez_(singer)) perform at the Opera House. Jose performed his first album, [Veneer](https://open.spotify.com/album/2e0BYdQ7VJlzSNHafdmfrl?autoplay=true) - which he mentioned is a short one and played a few covers, including [Massive Attack's Teardrop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s).

    With just him performing solo, it was an incredible and soulful performance.

* This day marks a year [since my last day at Adobe](/2022/06/22/thank-you-adobe). I still remember it like yesterday when I decided to leave and was waiting for my visa application and background verification to be approved - I didn't want to jump the gun. Given that Australia had just opened its borders and what our visa consultant had told us, I figured we had at least two months or so for the work visa to be approved. It turned out our visa was approved in a month, and that threw a whole lot of planning out of the window, especially since we wanted to do one more visit. Anyway, working with the API Platform team is something I will cherish for a really long time - we were a small team, but we did some amazing work, and I personally learned a lot from everyone in the team. I have a longer post of reflections on my 5 years, but that’s remained in draft for a year now. I hope to publish it soon.


### Link of the week

I've always believed Windows 3.1 was "just" a shell, a GUI on top of DOS. This post debunks that myth and explains why that isn't the case. Thought it was an [interesting read](https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4037306/myth-windows-3-1-was-just-a-shell-on-top-of-dos).
