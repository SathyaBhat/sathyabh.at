I’ve been blogging since early 2007 - that’s about 4 years. I started off with a blogger address but never posted any posts and then I didn’t bother. Few months later during my 7th sem holidays, I tried my hand at blogging again, with a standard WordPress.com account.

  Soon, moved over to shared hosting at Expertrio. Few months down the line, I grabbed my current domain just because Aalaap had mentioned it would be cool! Since I spent quite a lot on the Austrian (.at ) domain & wasn’t expecting much traffic, I decided to host it at a free host and selected <a href="https://x10hosting.com" target="_blank">x10 Hosting</a>. I used their free hosting for about 6 months, and then decided to move on to paid hosting.

  Couple months ago, Mixdev tweeted about a pretty nice deal that Secure Dragon was having and grabbed a basic VPS for <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mixdev/statuses/118721503645810689" target="_blank">tinkering about</a>. I also decided to move my personal blog & few other things that I had on the server on to the VPS. Even though I did have a little bit of Linux experience, it was pure desktop and had absolutely no clue about the server side of it.
</p>

Now that I had an unmanaged VPS, I needed to setup the required servers. Further searching resulted in me landing up on LowEndBox’s <a href="https://www.lowendbox.com/blog/wordpress-cheap-vps-lowendscript/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> about bootstrapping WordPress/nGinX/PHP/MySQL on a low end VPS system.

Now it goes without saying – you shouldn’t be running scripts directly off the Internet – even more so when you’re planning to run a server. LowEndBox’s script is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/lowendbox/lowendscript" target="_blank">Github</a>, so you can verify what the scripts are doing.

The software stack which is installed by LowEndBox

  * [dropbear][1] to replace openssh. Invoked from xinetd.
  * [inetutils-syslogd][2] to replace rsyslog.
  * [exim4][3] to replace sendmail (if installed). Re-configured to allow Internet delivery.
  * [cron][4]
  * [nginx][5]
  * [mysql][6]. Re-configured to remove innodb support, remove query cache and reduce key buffer size.
  * [php][7] with built-in FastCGI interface. Running only 1 child process and respawn after 5,000 requests.

Here’s what LowEndBox’s script does:

>   * Removing some commonly bundled applications that should not be there in the first place for a minimal distro (apache2, sendmail, bind9, samba, nscd, etc).
>   * MySQL root is given a new password (which can be found in `~root/.my.cnf`)
>   * Installing each WordPress site under /var/www/_<hostname>_. It will create appropriate database, users and password for the site.

Once the software was setup – here’s some things which I did, which weren’t part of the LowEndBox script:

  * Created a new <a href="https://oreilly.com/openbook/debian/book/ch07_01.html" target="_blank">user account</a>. This user account is used for all purposes – logging in, checking on server status, transferring files et al
  * Setup SSH keys to handle authentication when logging in. To do this:

  <p>
    First – set up a new account
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sudo" target="_blank">Enable sudo</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    setup ssh keys -
  </p>
  
  <p>
    From the vps type in ssh–keygen –t rsa
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enter passphrase, or leave it blank if you don’t want auth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Move the public key to authorised keys
  </p>
  
  <p>
    sathya@kurast:~/.ssh$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Copy the PK to local system.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (Thanks to <a href="https://www.cybermilitia.net/2009/02/28/dropbear-on-debian/">https://www.cybermilitia.net/2009/02/28/dropbear-on-debian/</a> )
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re using Putty to ssh, use Puttygen to convert the rsa pk to Putty private key. Launch Puttygen, Click conversions –> Import key. Point to your PK & click on convert. use the same passphrase as used above, or leave it blank.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This converted private key can now be used with PuTTY client (Connection -> SSH -> Auth -> “Private key file for authentication”),
