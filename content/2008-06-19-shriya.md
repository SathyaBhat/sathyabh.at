Yup, that's my neice, Shriya and her mum, my sis Supriya. Shriya now pretty much looks like my brother-in-law. I've been saying this since day 1 but then there was a slight bit of my sis's look in her. but now she's got nary a look of my sis in her. Hope to get to meet her soon.

Been a while since, I've been to Mangalore, ast time I'd gone here was in March. With Shriya's first birthday coming up in August, I hope I can get a week long leave to be with her duringÂ  her b'day.
