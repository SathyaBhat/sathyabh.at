I've been wearing contact lenses for more than 10 years now. Switched to contacts from my clunky spectacles when I started my PU(aka 11th).

When you use something for 16x7x365 (I won't say 24&#215;7, since the lenses are off when I'm sleeping), you tend to know it inside out. And especially when it's something like contact lenses, which sit on your eyeballs, every little change will result in instantaneous result. For instance, if you put on your lenses with an every-so-tiny speck of dirt that it's bloody invisible, trust me, you will know about it & you eyes will water like there's a big pump pushing out all the tears.

Anyways, all these years I've been using <a href="https://www.bausch.com/en/ECP/Our-Products/Contact-Lenses/Myopia-Contact-Lenses/SofLens-Daily-Disposables" target="_blank">Bausch & Lomb's SofLens</a> monthly disposable lenses. They're great. Actually, scratch the great part. They're fantastic. Fits perfectly, no shifting, no dryness nothing. If coloured lenses are your fancy, they come in various colours, but I've been on the stock ones, which have a light-blue visibility tint which is awesome if you ever do the scary part of dropping your lenses on the ground or in the kitchen sink.

I've tried some other lenses, mainly B&L's "permanent" ones(in reality, they're supposed to be changed every year or so), but these didn't suit my eyes & would go bad in less than 3-4 months. Also tried Johnson & Johnson's contact lenses, they were fine, but not as comfortable as SofLens.

Over the past few years, we've had HD shoved down our throats - everywhere from video to audio. Heck even FM stations started touting "HD quality radio" crap. And joining this "we have HD" queue is&#8230; \*drumroll\* B&L.  Yes. Bausch & Lomb claim their lenses have "HD" optics.

Whatever the heck **that** means. And on their webpage they have <a href="https://www.purevision2.com/demo.html" target="_blank">pretty, pretty pictures</a>(albeit served as Flash, so if you're on a laptop, move it away from your thighs else you'll have a Seekh Kebab down there) showing what happens when you wear their "HD" lenses. Apparently "blurred" images become crispy, squeaky clean & sharp. No more halos. Excuse me you brilliant folks at B&L PR and marketing, all those (blurred images, halos) are signs of a person wearing lenses **NOT** suited to them.

Curious to see how they actually work - I took the bait & bought them. For a <a href="https://www.lenskart.com/bausch-lomb-purevision2-hd-contact-lenses.html" target="_blank">pretty steep price</a>. Lenskart took about 10 days to deliver them. They forgot to ship the free lens solution & case which was to be included as part of the offer, but after a support ticket, they sent them to me via courier.

Been wearing these for about 2 [months now][1]. And as expected, the HD's just marketing gimmick. Everything looks the same. And to answer those who asked me on twitter, wearing "HD" lens and viewing a "HD" movie on "HD" monitor doesn't give you a 2160p display. Har, Har.

It's not just the ludicrous steep price that bothers me. These lenses don't have **any** visibility tints. Trying to find where the lenses are in the case itself is like fishing in the deep sea with your eyes blindfolded. Don't bother searching if you've dropped them. While there has been no "shifting", the lens tends to get dry a wee bit faster. And not to forget, the lens is a dirt magnet. Picks up dirt way faster than anything else that I've tried.

So to sum up: Don't buy 'em. HD or no HD, you won't find any difference. And you'll save some cash to buy another pair of lenses. Or for some shopping. Or beer. Whatever you prefer.
