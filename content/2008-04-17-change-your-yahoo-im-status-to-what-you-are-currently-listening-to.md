While on IM, one of the most common question everyone asks is - How do you show what song you're listening to? Well it's a no-brainer really, quite a few plugins exist which allow to do so, but most of them are buggy, don't work with one version or the other, or just don't work at all!

Well after doing a bit of research, I found an ideal plugin for Winamp - Yahoo Messenger 9/8/7 Now Playing v4.3, which works for Yahoo Messenger versions 7, 8 and even the beta version 9. You can grab it from <a href="https://numedecod.ro/Yahoo_Messenger_NowPlaying" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  
  
For those using Windows Media Player, there's a Messenger Data Plugin v1.1 which you can download from <a href="https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Chat/Other-Chat-Tools/MessengerData-WMP-Plugin-for-Yahoo-Messenger.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>

For those using Pidgin for all your IM needs, fear not, the MusicTracker plugin will send the now playing satuts to all of your Pidgin accounts. Even better, MusicTracker supports Winamp, Windows Media Player, iTunes and Foobar2000! Grab the MusicTracker plugin from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/musictracker" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

So what're you waiting for? Go grab those plugins and let people know, what you're listening to!
