### What's been happening

 It's been another busy week! Don't have a lot of updates

* It's oncall week. At the Trade Desk, at the moment SRE's role in oncall is primarily on a escalation basis, so I don't have to be the first person to response to any alerts. Plus it's only for work hours - but includes weekends as well. As such, I decided to not take the long weekend and work on Tuesday as well. I'll take another day off in lieu of this.
* Another social network gets popular. I'm seeing a lot of chatter and talk around Bluesky Social. Bluesky Social is a distributed social network, similar vein as Mastodon but different - it uses the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/). I fundamentally understand how ActivityPub works, but I'm yet to grok the At protocol. Maybe once I've used and read a bit more I can understand it better. For now, I wrote a small CLI tool that can login and post to BlueSky Web App. It'll be interesting to see how the growth of AT Protocol and BlueSky will be compared to Mastodon. With major FOMO due to the invite system, I've already seen lot of people announce that AT Protocol and BlueSky is where they will be, not Mastodon, and I can't understand why. Maybe because there's only one instance that looks similar to twitter of yore and without being policed about what should or should not be done in a specific instance is making people accept BlueSky more. We'll have to wait and watch.
* Just as I was about to wrap up this edition, I saw [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianGaming/comments/132hx5r/for_the_past_one_year_ive_been_teaching_myself) on Indian Gaming subreddit about a solo developer building a Stardew Valley inspired life sim set in South India with a special focus on [Toddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_wine). Certainly looks very interesting, will have to see if the charm of the small teaser video carries throughout the game, much like it does for Stardew. There's no dates yet, so maybe will be a while before it gets here.
 
### Link of the week

There's a thread on Hacker News about "[Most interesting tech you built for just yourself?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35729232)" that has some amazing things people have built. It's bit of a long read, so go ahead, save/bookmark that thread and read it at your own pace.
