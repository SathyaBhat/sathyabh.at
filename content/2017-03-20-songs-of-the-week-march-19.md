Only Love by Ben Howard



Spirit Cold by Tall Heights - watching their performance is truly incredible.



Electric Indigo by The Paper Kites - the chorus start riff is somewhat similar to the one in <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2017/02/11/songs-for-the-week-feb-12/" target="_blank">Bear's Den's Red Earth & Pouring</a> but nonetheless a great song to listen to



You Rascal You by Hann El Khatib



And some good ol' rock to end the post. Yes it's not new but still a great song. Do I Wanna Know? by Arctic Monkeys
