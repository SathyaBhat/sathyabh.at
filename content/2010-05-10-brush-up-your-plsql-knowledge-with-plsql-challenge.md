If you're looking to brush up on your PL/SQL knowledge, [PL/SQL challenge][1] is pretty nice. It's a daily challenge quiz, where you are presented with Â multiple choice or true/false questions. It's an initiative by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Feuerstein" target="_blank">Steven Feuerstein</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Feuerstein" target="_blank"></a>, who's pretty well known. I just joined in, first few questions were not too tough ðŸ™‚ Join in, there's [some great prizes to be won][2] .

If you know of any more such websites, do drop in a comment and let me know.

(PS: If you're wondering what's with the weird URL structure, well its built on [Oracle Apex][3]. Long, clumsy URLs are a pain, and Apex does nothing to banish them).
