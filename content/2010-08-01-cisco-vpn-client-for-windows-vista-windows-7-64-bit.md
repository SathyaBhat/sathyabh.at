I've been looking for a reliable VPN client, one which works well on Windows Vista / Windows 7 and especially one which can connect to a IPsec'd Cisco VPN.

Of course there's Cisco's default VPN client but the one given to me is a crappy old 4.6 version, and works only on Windows XP. Tried to get the AnyConnect version, but after PITA registration and deep digging into a hopelessly unnavigable site, found that I cannot download it using a "standard" registration account :-\

Anyhow, I've been using ShrewSoft's VPN Client for now, its pretty neat,  user  friendly(well, unless you're trying to create a new connection anyway) , works great and can import Cisco's pcf profile files as well, saving you the trouble of having break your head in configuring one.

So, go grab it now!

[Windows Download Link][1] | [Linux Download Link][2]

(PS: Haven't yet tested the Linux version, will post on my [Linux blog][3] after trying it out)

Update: [Swaroop][4] just [informed me][5] about Cisco's [WebVPN][6]. Neat stuff, but requires additional config from Net Admins.
