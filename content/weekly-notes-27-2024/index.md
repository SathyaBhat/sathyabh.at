### What's been happening

It's been a busy week

* I've been preparing for my PTE Academic test by watching a fair bit of YouTube videos on how to prepare and what sort of questions are expected. PTE Academic Test is required to demonstrate my English language proficiency for my upcoming Australian PR application, and I must admit I am a bit intimidated by this. I haven't done any tests in a long time, and PTE Academic is a completely automated way of grading your answers, even though the answers can be subjective and the tests cover Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. Jo will do her test on Sunday afternoon, and I will have mine on Monday. Hopefully, we will both pass the test with the required scores. 
* After a long time, I've spruced up my tech blog theme, as well as cleaned up some of the older articles. There are a lot of the older articles that are simply not relevant anymore, with many links being dead so I removed the links, and moved the older posts to an [archives](https://sathyasays.com/archives) section so that thye don't show up when navigating via the previous posts, but direct links to them will still work. 
* A busy concert weekend -
  * Agam at Roundhouse, University of NSW. I've heard of Agam since a long time but had never listened to any of their songs. Overall, I really enjoyed the concert. The concert started about 20 minutes late, but once they started performing, it was quite sublime. Harish is really good in crowd management, getting the audience to sing with him, or keep it down. The entire band was terrific. The lead guitarist pulling an amazing violin-like sounds of that electic guitar, Jaggi, the rhythm guitarist's prog/metal riff backing where superb, but the unsung heroâ€™s were the bassist and the Indian percussionist. Their subtle touches added amazing depth to all the entire performance and elevated it to the next level. I would highly recommend watching them live if they're your city.
  * Zakir Hussain, Kala Ramnath, and Jayanthi Kumaresh in Triveni at the Opera House

### Music of the Week

One of the things I love the most about going to live gigs is to find other live versions of them performing and being able to contrast how they played live, or what improvisations they did. So here's a relatively old series of videos but I had no idea existed - Agam's live series of performances. I love that there's either a background choir with voices, strings, sitar, or the other instruments. Wonderful series of videos. 

### Link of the week

Retool has a fantastic article, with some great visuals talking about [the history of Yahoo Pipes](https://retool.com/pipes). 

I remember reading about Yahoo pipes back in the day and was fascinated with web technology, with pipes, with RSS. In today's world, IFTTT, Z
