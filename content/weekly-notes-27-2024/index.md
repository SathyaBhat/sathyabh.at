### What's been happening

It's been a busy week

* I've been preparing for my PTE Academic test by watching a fair bit of YouTube videos on how to prepare and what sort of questions are expected. PTE Academic Test is required to demonstrate my English language proficiency for my upcoming Australian PR application, and I must admit I am a bit intimidated by this. I haven't done any tests in a long time, and PTE Academic is a completely automated way of grading your answers, even though the answers can be subjective and the tests cover Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. Jo will do her test on Sunday afternoon, and I will have mine on Monday. Hopefully, we will both pass the test with the required scores.
