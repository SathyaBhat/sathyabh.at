Well, I'm pretty sure most of you are heavy GMail users. For me **[GMail][1]** is my primary mail service now, with my domain-based mail running on Google Apps. As good as a service GMail is I find certain things annoying - such as the the way it defaults to top posting instead of bottom posting! And of course the default interface is a bit bland. That's where Better GMail comes in. Better GMail is a collection of **[Greasemonkey][2]** userscripts all rolled into 1 neat Firefox addon!

Some of the features Better GMail has include

  * Support for themes
  * Saved searches
  * Keyboard macros
  * HTML signatures
  * Bottom posting instead of top posting
  * Attachment icons indicating file types
  * Unread mail count in tabs

<!--more-->



Better Gmail comes in 2 versions, Better GMail and Better Gmail 2. Better Gmail is for those using the older version of Gmail, and Better GMail2 is for - you guessed it the newer version(you can distinguish between the 2 versions, the newer version will have a link for Older Version in the top right corner).

You can get Better Gmail from **<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4866" target="_blank">here</a>**, and better GMail 2 from **<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6076" target="_blank">here</a>**.

here's a screenshot of my GMail after using Better Gmail
