This place has been quiet for a some time now, sorry about that. Call it procrastination/laziness/busy work life/twitter effect/#HusbandLife - I haven't posted since a while. Lot has happened, I'll try to write on them in due course.

### EuroTrip

Right, Eurotrip. Although nowhere close to being like the <a title="Eurotrip" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356150/" target="_blank">movie</a> or <a title="#RichManSid #PoshManSid #BeerSid #KarmaSid #SweatySid #NoMoreForeverAloneSid" href="https://twitter.com/ashwinsid" target="_blank">#PoshManSid</a>'s <a href="https://medium.com/@ashwinsid/a-guide-to-plan-an-affordable-eurotrip-with-travel-log-recommendations-34fa837bd398" target="_blank">trip</a>, my project management decided that it was about time I made a brief one month visit to Helsinki.
