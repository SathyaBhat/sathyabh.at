You guys should be knowing about what's been happening in Mumbai all this while.

If not, a brief round up on twitter, Wikipedia, by Aditya and Kunal Sheth.

Photos and videos speak better than words so here's Vinu's flickr profile and of course, Aravind's Magnum Opus, Hash Mumbai.

[edit]

Saket aka Vulturo speaks his mind out.

Vijayendra Mohanty writes an open letter to the media and gets a response.

Chetan Kunte on some \*excellent\* journalism that I mention below.

[PS: Got more links? Drop a comment, I'll add]

Salute to all the Brave Police, Army Men, NSG Commandos, ATS guys. Without you guys, we would be nowhere.

Politicans - meh. I'll save my breath, they aren't worth it.

Reporters: Great job, especially on giving out VITAL information like where the Commandos are stationed and what not /sarcasm.
