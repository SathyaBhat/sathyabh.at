### What's been happening

It's a been a busy week.

* I wrote a blog post about how I tried to use hostname spoofing on a HTTPS request with curl and the `Host` header and it didn't work as I thought it would. Give it a read on [my tech blog](https://sathyasays.com/2023/07/18/curl-tls-sni-hostname-spoof/) if you're interested.

* After more than 1.5 years of job hunting (combined in Romania + Australia), Jo finally got a job. She starts tomorrow :) I am sure she will do well. 

* We've decided to extend the stay at our current place, given that Jo will be occupied with her new job and I've been rather busy at work, with the PR application (that's a post for another day). 

* One of the biggest pains and unspoken things about relocation.. is taxation. I've been using [Daftery & Associates](https://www.dafteryassociates.com/) as my CA for the past few years (I used to do the taxes by myself for a long time. Once I [moved to Romania](/2020/01/08/salut-bucharest/), it was too much for me to manage) and I've been pretty happy with them. I got this year's ITR done, and Australia's tax season is here, so I have to figure that out as well.

### Link of the week

Two links, both related to #90skids.. 

* [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick) died earlier this week from cancer. Give this [obituary](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/las-vegas-nv/kevin-mitnick-11371668) a read.  
* [The ‘90s Internet: When 20 hours online triggered an email from my ISP’s president](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/the-90s-internet-when-20-hours-online-triggered-an-email-from-my-isps-president/) a nostalgic post talking about back in the days of dial-up internet, where your Internet connection wasn't always online and you'd get charged by telephone company because dial-up internet kept your phone busy and by your ISP (because you had to purchase a limited hour pack). Yes, you bought hours of allocation. Not always online.
