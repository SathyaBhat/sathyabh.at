Since each service now offers its look back at 2025 / year in review / wrapped, I figured it'd be nice to collect them all in one place. Here's from the past few years:

- [2024](/wrap-up-of-wrap-ups-2024/) 
- [2023](/2022/12/31/wrap-up-of-wrap-ups-2023/)
- [2022](/2022/12/31/wrap-up-of-wrap-ups-2022)

### Music

No changes here, Rock is still my most listened-to genre. Nora En Pure takes the top artist, and that's because I've been listening to lot of her and Chill/Deep House especially during traels as it's a great genre to relax to. My top Songs 2025 is on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXdh0favfbubxr?si=bc032ad7e2ec4aab).

### Gaming

Another year of good gaming! My Steam Replay shows mix of new games (Path of Exile 2, Civilization VII, BALL x PIT) as well as old favorites. Civilization VII and Path of Exile 2 takes the top spots, with each contributing to about 27% of my playtime. Civilization VII has improved leaps and bounds since launch, especially the multiplayer sessions in the past few months have been very stable. I tried playing Last Epoch for a bit as well but that didn't hold up for long.

Path of Exile 2 still absorbs me with the new leagues, all of which I played lots of. There's still quite a bit of frustration with the game, but I'm still enjoying it. BALL x PIT is the most recent new game that I've been playing quite a bit of. They more updates coming the next year and I'm excited to see what they bring.

A notable mention to Cookie Clicker - I wanted to understand what this offline/clicker craze was all about. I see the appeal, but there's too much tedium especially when you're trying to get to the next level.

### Fitness

I started strength training last October but this year made it a goal to do at least 2 sessions a week, every week for a year straight. And I did it! The result? Since last year, I've lost  20 kgs down, can deadlift & squat 80kg, my resting heart rate is down 10bpm and just feel so much better and fitter. I've started doing regular morning walks with Jo and I've noticed those walks have become much easier as well. A big shout out to my trainer for his great training routine, motivation and the fabulous jokes that make the sessions such a joy.

That's for the wrap. Here's a look back at [2025](/a-look-back-at-2025/) and to the new year!
