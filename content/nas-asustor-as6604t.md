I'd been meaning to buy a NAS unit since quite some time, but it never masterialized. Now that things had settled down a bit, I started doing some research about NAS devices. I spent a lot of time reading, watching YouTube videos) - especially a lot Synology vs QNAP ones and nearly was ready to purchase it when I came across [Jeff Geerling's review of the Asustor Lockerstor 4 AS6604T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBccak8f-VY) and found it quite good. Given that it was available and Centercomm had a sale going on for it, I purchased it along with two Seagate IronWolf 6TB hard drives.

### Unboxing

The AS6604T came in a fairly standard box. There was a nice foam padding on inside to prevent some damage during shipping. There was a separate accessories box that came with an external power brick, cable ties, screws to hold the drives to the caddy and 2x CAT 5e LAN cables. Note that this is a 4-bay diskless unit and didn't come with any drives - I ordered two Seagate IronWolf 6TB disks separately (hindsight, ordering two drives together in general is not a good idea as they might be of the same batch and might fail together). The CAT 5e cables with the box meant that I didn't have to go hunting for LAN cables and is a nice addition
