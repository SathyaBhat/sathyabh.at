Couple of weeks back, Vinayak and his family were visiting Sydney and I reached out to him asking if he had any specific plans for the weekend. Knowing that he didn't have any plans and both Jo and I have been meaning to visit the Blue Mountains, we figured this is a good time to do a roadtrip!

### About the Blue Mountains

The Blue Mountains are a mountainous region starting at about 50 kilometers west of Sydney. The mountains are part of the Great Dividing Range, which runs along the east coast of Australia. The Blue Mountains area comprises a range of mountains, waterfalls, and eucalyptus forests and are famous for having many hiking trails and scenic drives especially during Autumn.

### Getting there

Since moving to Sydney, my standard for a roadtrip has been booking a GoGet. Since we are a group of 5 this time around, I booked a Toyota RAV4. GoGet's tariff means that when the hourly rate crosses the daily rate, they will automatically apply the daily rate, so we always get a lower tariff. We picked up the RAV4 just outside our house and started heading towards Vinayak's hotel to pick them up. The hotel was barely 2kms away and the RAV4 did not have CarPlay, but however it did come with SatNav. I always wanted to try out the SatNav and so I punched in the street number and name and headed off.. only to realize why CarPlay/Google Maps is used so much. The SatNav was horribly bad, kept giving wrong instructions and a 2km trip ended up being a 5km drive across the city tunnel. I promptly put away the SatNav and switched back to Google Maps.

The rest of the drive to Blue Mountains was pretty uneventful as we were on the M4 and Great Western Highway and the roads were straight. As we got closer to the Blue Mountains we started seeing some curves, and the foliage changed a bit. I'm told the colours are lot more brighter closer towards Autumn. We could also see the railway track run parallel to the road (and fun fact: you can actually reach Blue Mountains via public transport, via the train to Katoomba). Our first stop was Lincoln's Rock, about 94kms from our home and it took us about 2 hours to cover the distance

Lincoln's Rock is a popular cliff-edge lookout in the Blue Mountains. It has some amazing views of the mountains. Lincoln's Rock is named after Lincoln Hall, a mountaineer resident of Blue Mountains. As a mountaineer, he was part of Australiaâ€™s first Mount Everest expedition in 1984. Licoln left for dead after a successful ascent to Mt Everest and lost his way on descent. 

We parked the car and walked to the lookout. The place wasn't full but soon after couple of buses made their way and it got fairly congested. The expansive view of the ranges and the valley was pretty awesome. There's a particular place that you can sit and grab a photo of - and that proved to be quite popular with a tour group. The tour lead kept repeating the instructions repeatedly - "shuffle on your butts!". Became second nature to everyone there!

### Three Sisters 

After spending about half hour here, some time here, we headed off towards Katoomba, for the famous Three Sisters walk. 

The Three Sisters Walk is about a 45 minute drive from Lincoln Rock. This place is quite heavily crowded, so expect to drive around for a bit to get a parking spot. The view from The Three Sisters' was awesome. Our plans to do the walk to the first sister however was dashed, as the bridge to it was closed. The other hiking trail was much longer and we didn't feel like doing it.

By this time, it was close to lunch and we were hungry. We looked at couple of cafes and decided to head over to Basil Nut Cafe. We chose to sat outside since the indoor seating was full. Basil Nut Cafe had really good food! Fresh ingredients and good quantity. Would highly recommend if you're in Katoomba.

### Walking around in Katoomba

With lunch over, we picked up couple of coffees and started walking about Katoomba city center. Vinayak was looking for the Cultural Center, and just infront of the Cultural Center we found several amazing murals and graffiti on the walls, across multiple cross roads. Some of the artwork were amazing and had special traits - a notable one were a mural would show a "hidden" face only when viewed at a certain angle. Katoomba is filled with many quaint shops from speciality gift shops (we checked out one focused on cat-themed apparel including mitten that had paw marks on them - very cute!), little bookstores, antique shops etc.

We must have easily spent couple of hours with the lunch and then the walk about, and by this time (approx 4pm), it was getting dark as the sunlight was fading out. Our plans for a waterfall hike had fallen through, so we decided to make one final stop at Everglades House & Gardens. Unfortunately by the time we reached there, the place had closed, so we could only some picturesfrom outside.

With that, we started heading back to Sydney as we had other plans in Sydney and didn't want to delay those. Hope you enjoyed reading this.
