What a year. At the start of the year, I thought I'd get more familiar with Romania and Romanian, explore more of the country. Instead, we ended up doing a Transylvania tour, took a hard decision to leave Adobe and Romania, took a two month break, did yet another cross-continental move to Sydney, joined The Trade Desk, picked up COVID-19 after all those years of dodging, went to AWS re:Invent 2022 and celebrated Christmas in Brisbane. In between this, I helped organize another CDK Day, gave [couple of talks](https://sathyasays.com/talks/) and learnt Typescript.

### By the months

Here's what happened in the months:

**January:** January was pretty averag, but the weird regulations that applies to non-EU citizens started getting really annoying, and I started thinking of moving out of Romania. Just as I was looking at open positions at The Trade Desk, Shantanu reached out to me. Felt that was quite a co-incidence and asked him to put me in touch with a recruiter. By the end of January, I had completed two rounds of the interview, without having done any interview prep for the past 6 years. Surprisingly enough, I cleared the two rounds and was told the next set of interviews would be a 4-round panel interview.

**February**: Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Being in Romania, things were a bit tense given Romania shares its border with Ukraine. Since we were down south in Bucharest, we didn't feel much, apart from all the news about Indian students being evacuated from Ukraine, by/via ROmania. It was kinda funny that a lot of people back home realized where exactly Romania was. We were thinking of vacationing up north in [Maramure»ô](https://romaniatourism.com/maramures.html), but given the war we had to rethink about the plan.

**March**: March was a month of major changes. I turned towards the wrong side of the late 30s (lol).  After 4+ rounds of interviews, negotiating, and discussing, I got a conditional offer from The Trade Desk. I was happy, but it was conditional to background verification clearance and Australian Department of Home Affairs approving my temporary skilled visa (TSS 482). Started working towards the visa application. Spent a lot of time in getting the paperwork done for the visa. The toughest papers were the PCC from India, which took a leisurely 4 weeks and trying to determine whether I should take IELTS/alternatives. In the end, I talked to Dad who managed to get certificates from my school and college verifying that I had completed 5 years of secondary schooling (I found this funny - I've written three books and yet I need to prove that I know English). Jo & I decided to do a guided tour of Transylvania. CHeck out this [blog post](https://sathyabh.at/2022/03/19/exploring-romania-transylvania/) for the plan and [the series](https://sathyabh.at/2022/03/19/exploring-romania-transylvania/) for the travelogue (WIP, I know...). It was probably one of the best tours we'd been on, no thanks to Florin Ionescu from [Sibiutourguide.com](https://sibiutourguide.com/). Would highly recommend Florin if you're thinking of doing a tour!

**April**: Back from the vacation and not much to do - finally picked up the last set of documents required to apply for my visa and submitted them, waiting for news of the approval.

**May**: May was going ok till we got yet another big news - our visa had been approved! We were stunned - we didn't expect the visa to be approved so fast. It was part jubiliation, part omgwtf. We suddenly had so many things to do! Figure out what to pack, what to sell. We had to figure out till when we will be in Bucharest, my notice period (and to my surprise, my manager essentially told me I'm free to choose my exit date). Ultimately, I decided to set [end of May as my last working day](https://sathyabh.at/2022/06/22/thank-you-adobe/) and mid June as the date to leave Romania.

**June**: Having signed off from work, we

**July**: In July, we took our first holiday in Romania. With daily COVID cases going down to mid-double digits, we felt at ease in traveling. THe vacation started with a 3-day visit to the coastal city of Constanta. Not content with having to return to Bucharest, we made an impulse decision to head to Brasov to complete the week's vacation. Check the picture albums from [Constanta](https://pics.sathyabh.at/constanta-2021) and [Brasov](https://pics.sathyabh.at/brasov-2021).

**August**: Was fairly busy with work, and started working on [The CDK Book](https://www.thecdkbook.com/), the second edition of Practical Docker With Python.

{{< fancybox "https://i.sathyabh.at/sb/2022-look-back" "august_manly_beach.jpg" "Spring time" "Look back at 2022" >}}


**September**: Work and other projects like [The CDK Book](https://www.thecdkbook.com/), the second edition of Practical Docker With Python, continued to take up my time. Not content with this, I started helping with organizing [AWS Community Day South Asia](https://communityday.awsug.asia/). Started paperwork for renewing my EU Blue Card.

**October**: Finished work on Practical Docker with Python, and the AWS Community Day Asia happened on October 22 that was well received. Just my paperwork was being processed, and we were getting cozy in our house, the landlady of our house informed us to move out as they were selling the house. See [this post for details](/2021/11/11/moving-house/).

**November**: With re:Invent just around the corner, and no sign of my EU Blue card, I cancelled the re:Invent visit. This was kind of disappointing as I really wanted to be at re:Invent as we planned to launch The CDK Book. I gave a talk at JAWS Pankration 2021.

**December**: My EU blue card arrived, or so I thought - they sent a resident permit instead. See this post [for the details](https://sathyabh.at/2021/12/25/blue-card-blues/). The [print edition of Practical Docker with Python](https://sathyasays.com/2021/12/20/practical-docker-with-python-second-edition/) finally hit the markets. Spent the Christmas and winter break by first [getting my booster shot](https://sathyabh.at/2022/01/03/covid-booster/) and then relaxing at home and couple of Christmas market visits in Bucharest.

### Gaming

This time, most of my gaming revolved around Civilization 6. 

* Snow Runner (finished one map, gave up soon after)
* Diablo 3 (but, of course)
* Diablo 2 Resurrected 
* Divinity 2: Original Sin
* Euro Truck Simulator
* Forza Horizon 5

### What's for 2023?

In 2021, in trying to get my mind off the anxiety of COVID and trying to get Jo here meant I picked up a lot of projects to keep my mind occupied. This year, I am looking at scaling back a little and just relax. Of course, I'll look at supporting one or two events (definitely the next CDK Day) but mostly, I'm looking at getting my driver's license in Romania and travel more. And of course, play more games and dust off my PS4 & the Switch.

Wish the best of 2023!
