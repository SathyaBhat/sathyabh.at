### Summary 

What a year. At the start of the year, I thought I'd get more familiar with Romania, Romanian and explore more of the country. Instead, we ended up doing a Transylvania tour, took a hard decision to leave Adobe and Romania. I took a two month break in between jobs and we ended up doing yet another cross-continental move - this time to Sydney and joined The Trade Desk as a Staff Software Engineer.

Towards the end of the year, I went back to Vegas for AWS re:Invent, picked up COVID-19 after all those years of dodging, and celebrated Christmas in Brisbane with family. In between this, I helped organize another CDK Day, gave [a couple of talks](https://sathyasays.com/talks/) and learnt Typescript.

### By the months

Here's what happened in the months:

**January:** January was pretty average.  Romania's restrictions and regulations to non-EU citizens got to us and I started thinking of moving out of Romania. Just as I was looking at open positions at The Trade Desk, [Shantanu](https://twitter.com/shantanugoel) reached out to me. Felt that was quite a co-incidence and asked him to put me in touch with a recruiter. By the end of January, I had completed two rounds of the interview, without having done any interview prep for the past 6 years. Surprisingly enough, I cleared the two rounds and was told the next set of interviews would be a 4-round panel interview.

**February**: Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Being in Romania, things were a bit tense given Romania shares its border with Ukraine. Since we were down south in Bucharest, we didn't feel much. The news about the Indian students being evacuated from Ukraine via Romania put Romania and us being in Romania to lot of friends/family back home. It was kinda funny that a lot of people back home realized where exactly Romania was. We were thinking of vacationing up north in [MaramureÈ™](https://romaniatourism.com/maramures.html), but given the war we had to rethink about the plan.

**March**: March was a month of major changes. I turned towards the wrong side of the late 30s (lol).  After 4+ rounds of interviews, negotiating, and discussing, I got a conditional offer from The Trade Desk. I was happy, but it was conditional to background verification clearance and Australian Department of Home Affairs approving my visa (TSS 482 class visa to be specific). Started working towards filling the visa application. Spent a lot of time in getting the paperwork done for the visa. The toughest papers were the PCC (Police Clearance Certificate) from India, which took a leisurely 4 weeks (plus a video call with the cop who came to "visit" us to clear our file ðŸ™„). I was also trying to determine if I should take the IELTS or other alternative English tests that is required for the visa, but found out that I can get an exemption for this, provided I can prove that I have 5 years of study in secondary schooling with English as the medium of instruction. Ultimately, my Dad managed to get certificates from my school and college verifying that I had completed 5 years of secondary schooling and I could skip the tests. I found this funny that I've written three books and yet I need to prove that I "know" English.

With the MaramureÈ™ trip not possible, Jo & I decided to do a guided tour of Transylvania instead. CHeck out this [blog post](https://sathyabh.at/2022/03/19/exploring-romania-transylvania/) for the plan and [the series](https://sathyabh.at/2022/03/19/exploring-romania-transylvania/) for the travelogue (WIP, I know...). It was probably one of the best tours we'd been on, no thanks to Florin Ionescu from [Sibiutourguide.com](https://sibiutourguide.com/). Would highly recommend Florin if you're thinking of doing a tour!

**April**: Back from the vacation and not much to do - finally picked up the last set of documents required to apply for my visa and submitted them, waiting for news of the approval.

**May**: May was going ok till we got yet another big news - our visa had been approved! We were stunned - we didn't expect the visa to be approved so fast. It was part jubiliation, part omgwtf. We suddenly had so many things to do! Figure out what to pack, what to sell. We had to figure out till when we will be in Bucharest, my notice period (and to my surprise, my manager essentially told me I'm free to choose my exit date). Ultimately, I decided to set [end of May as my last working day](https://sathyabh.at/2022/06/22/thank-you-adobe/) and mid June as the date to leave Romania.

**June**: Having signed off from work, we spent the first few days of June frantically packing up, preparing to leave, finishing off paperwork (for ex, closing bank accounts and such). The Trade Desk had offered relocation support for our move, and when we contacted the relocation specialists, we were suggested it'd be more cost effective for us if we took what we wanted paid off as excess baggage than shipping - in fact, for our stuff, we got a quote for over $7000! We decided to go the excess baggage route and that meant more packing, weighing and moving luggage around till we had distributed them evenly. Meanwhile, in the evening we tried to visit some of the places one last time before we left.

Once back in India, we spent first few days in Bangalore before heading home to Mangalore and a day trip to Jog falls with my parents.

**July**: In July, we started preparing for moving to Sydney - we started looking at different suburbs, trying to figure where to stay. We had planned for a Goa roadtrip in the monsoons (last we did was in 2016), so drove over and stayed in Benaulim. It was the first time that I was driving since 2019, and it felt really good to be back at the steering wheel! It was also raining much heavier than what I'd have liked to, so I had to drive a bit slower. Goa and the Konkan coast during the monsoons is just incredible, I would highly recommend doing a road trip to Goa during June-July if you can. After heading back to Mangalore, we spent couple of days more and then flew to Bangalore to prepare our final move. And finally, after nearly two months of break, we moved to Sydney on the third week of July, and ended up visiting the Opera House the same weekend!

**August**: August was the month of expenses - we had been staying at a temporary house that Trade Desk had arranged for as part of the relocation, but found a great rental house in Surry Hills. We understood how mad the Sydney real estate and rental scene was. The houses in Sydney are unfurnished (unlike in Bucharest - where most of the houses) and we had to buy all the appliances, furniture, utensils etc. I also found out how poor Sydney's Internet scene is (compared to Bucharest). On the positive side, I applied for a GoGet smart card and that was approved, so I could use GoGet to rent a car by the hour (much like Zoomcar in India etc) - and this has been such a blessing, being able to rent a car by the hour, for ex to take stuff you bought at Ikea or other such places.

### Gaming

This time, most of my gaming revolved around Civilization 6. For couple of months after we left Bucharest and till we properly setup the house, I played on the Switch a fair bit, particularly Stardew Valley. Check out my previous post on the [wrap-up of wrap-ups to see the full breakdown of what I played on Steam and Switch](/2022/12/31/wrap-up-of-wrap-ups-2022). 


### What's for 2023?

In 2021, in trying to get my mind off the anxiety of COVID and trying to get Jo here meant I picked up a lot of projects to keep my mind occupied. This year, I am looking at scaling back a little and just relax. Of course, I'll look at supporting one or two events (definitely the next CDK Day) but mostly, I'm looking at getting my driver's license in Romania and travel more. And of course, play more games and dust off my PS4 & the Switch.

Wish the best of 2023!
