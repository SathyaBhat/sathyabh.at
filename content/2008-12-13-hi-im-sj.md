You know very few people know my full name. Most people call me as "Sathya", my twittter friends "SathyaBhat". Mainly that'd would because I've never mentioned it - not because of "privacy reasons" or I have a name which would cause certain problems - its just that it's sorta too long - I mean who wouldn't prefer calling "Sathya" to "Sathyajith Bhat?".

Now that I'm here in US - I've had to further shorten my name. I mean I didn't expect people to pronounce "Sathyajith" (trust me they tried, tried and were like "Saaa- I give up??" ). Well people have had problems calling my shortened name "Sathya" - I mean here they ask your name for everything - whenever you other something at the restaurant etc,Â  and everytime I say "Sathya" people would be like "pardon me?". So from Sathyajith Bhat to Sathyajith to SathyaBhat to Sathya - now its SJ.
