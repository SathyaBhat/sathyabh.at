No, no, no a baby as in baby kid, but my new cell. Yesterday, I finally changed my nearly a year old [Sony Ericsson z530i][1], which was gifted by my dad to me on my birthday and bought a spankin' new [Sony Ericsson P1i][2], which is a TouchScreen, Symbian UIQ based. I was all set to buy the [Sony Ericsson W910][3], since initially I thought the P1i would be beyond my budget. On checking the prices, it was within my limit, and I snapped it right-away. A 3.2MP cam, nice 2.4&#8243; screen, with a 320&#215;240 screen resolution, a Walkman media player(without the Walkman branding though, but it does have the Walkman propreitory MegaBass preset), QuickOffice for viewing Word, Excel, Powerpoint files, PDF+, a PDF reader are bundled along with it. Will post a review on it soon, once I've used it for a while and can expect more photos on my [Flickr][4] photostream on the left sidebar, as well as on my [Flickr account][5]. Would've loved to post some pictures but [ShoZu][6] servers are down and have been unable to activate it for my cell.
