### What's been happening

* It's been another quiet week. I had a couple of my colleagues come over from the US and thus was in the office most of the week. 
* Jo found a nice Japanese restaurant called [Ryo's Noodles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nNghRhi3o1UbrNds6) and wanted to go there last week, but I was too exhausted from the move and told her we'd go later. That later never came for us but I took my colleagues to this restaurant and loved the food here! Ryo’s Noodles is a cozy little Japanese restaurant. They have amazing ramen. The place is quite small and can get a bit stuffy and you can expect a fair bit of wait but it’s worth it!

* As part of the Trade Desk's Christmas gift, I chose a record player, and the player was delivered this week. It's a [Victrola Eastwood](https://www.victrola.com.au/products/p/the-eastwood-hybrid-turntable). What I like about the player is that it supports Bluetooth output, thus I can play the music through my Bang & Olufsen M5 since the speakers on the Eastwood aren't that great. 
    * We had bought a few records a while back, and we found out there's a second-hand book & record store nearby and so went and bought a few more records.

* After many years, [Last Epoch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/), an ARPG that I've been following keenly is out of early access and had a public 1.0 release this week. Last Epoch comes with full offline as well as online modes, and as with most games on launch dates, the online mode was completely swamped and most people had trouble logging in. I started a completely offline character and have been enjoying it. 

* My good friend [Saurabh](https://mastodon.social/@the100rabh) has started writing his weekly series on "Interesting Things I Learnt this week". You might find this [fascinating](https://blog.100rabh.com/2024/02/feb-18-interesting-things-i-learnt-this.html)!

### Music of the Week

When you need to listen to [Something Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNYjOVo5IEw), alt-J doesn't disappoint.

### Link of the week

I came across [this post which](https://bbycroft.net/llm) is a visualization and walkthrough of the LLM algorithm. I read the introduction section a bunch of times and it doesn't make sense to me, but hey the visualization is nice.
