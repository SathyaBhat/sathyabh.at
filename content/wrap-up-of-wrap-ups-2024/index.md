Since each service now offers its look back at 2024 / year in review / wrapped, I figured it'd be nice to collect them all in one place. Here's from the past few years:

- [2023](https://sathyabh.at/2022/12/31/wrap-up-of-wrap-ups-2023/)
- [2022](https://sathyabh.at/2022/12/31/wrap-up-of-wrap-ups-2022)

### Music

No changes here, Rock is still my most listened-to genre. One interesting change is Ludovico Einaudi at the top of the artists section. Jo & I watched Einaudi [perform live](/weekly-notes-06-2024/) at the Opera House and that was the catalyst for me to go on a 3-day bing listening mode. With 642 artists listened to, playing a song more than a couple of times brings it to my top list. I've recorded Spotify's wrapped and published it to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKNGkrEwmCQ). Want to listen to my Top Songs 2024 playlist? Find it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1FoJh1nmkslHTK?si=63001541b0004598).

### Gaming

Another year of good gaming! My Steam Replay shows mix of new games (Last Epoch, Transport Fever 2, Balatro) as well as old favorites.

Civilization VI takes the top game, but that's only because I don't have Diablo IV on Steam - else that would have taken the top step. There's a bunch of newer games as well - I played quite a bit of Last Epoch, Balatro, Dave The Diver, Hades 2, Transport Fever 2, Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, and Path of Exile 2 (and enjoyed all of them).

### Fitness

Towards the second half of the year, Jo & I took a more serious look at improving our fitness levels. We signed up for a [boxing gym at first](/weekly-notes-38-2024/) and that got us to a good mindset and habit of walking into a gym without dreading it. Unfortunately, a few weeks in they shut down, but I joined a more [traditional strength training gym](/weekly-notes-43-2024/) and that's helped me improve my fitness levels so much. Strava's year in fitness shows absurd levels of increase but that's just indicative of how little physical exercise we got. I look forward to continuing this and hope to get to my next target weight goal.
