### What's been happening

We started our week with potentially my final concert of the year. Jo has another K-POP artist concert at a later date. We went to see John Butler perform at the City Recital hall. I came across John Butler with his incredibly awesome song Ocean that I have referenced under my prior [Music of the week](/weekly-notes-35-2024/) and to catch him live is not something I would have wanted to miss. John Performed his latest instrumental album, [Still Searching](https://open.spotify.com/album/4rGSui8BAT9L627KTqlZ6t?si=yMtD3lqQTte3MWSXDLIJvA) plus a few other songs including Ocean. To see an amazing guitar player such as John was quite incredible and to have two percussionists join the stage and perform with him was even better. This was one of the most amazing recitals that I have been to yet and would highly recommend checking out his show if you ever get to see him live.

It's also time for our [vacation](/weekly-notes-44-2024/) - Jo and I are flying to Mangalore this Saturday via Bangalore. We'll be in Mangalore for couple of weeks. Looking forward to the break!

### Music of the Week

[Colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G383538qzQ) is a fantastic song by American psychedelic soul band [Black Pumas](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6eU0jV2eEZ8XTM7EmlguK6?si=_IRJ6qB-RRa6UzxcGqKxDA). The song's got everything - fantastic voice, great backing vocals, some killer riffs and a keyboard solo to finish it off. Great track if you like soul!

### Link of the week

Have you ever wondered why electric trains (for example the metro/subway ones) make funny noises, or a crescendo of notes while starting? This fantastic video dives into how electric trains work and why they make interesting sounds.
