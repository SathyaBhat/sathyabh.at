I missed last week's post, but back this week. Enjoy ♫♬

Zac Saber's Soak Up The Sun : Some lovely guitars and harmonica



Hunck's Never Had a Dream - some incredibly transcending electronica/sob rock



Rynn's Islands: Incredibly relaxing song



Sam Roberts Band's TerraForm: Another great song that's not been heard much



and rounding up for this week is Ghost's Square Hammer. Funky video and great music to boot. Bonus feature: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(Swedish_band)" target="_blank">Read up on the band</a>. Not your usual stuff.



Till next week!
