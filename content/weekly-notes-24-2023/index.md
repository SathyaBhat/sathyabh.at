### What's been happening

It's been a bad week for my gadgets. Let's dive in.

* I flew into the USA this week. Before boarding, I spent couple of hours at the American Express Centurion lounge in Sydney and I was pretty disappointed. A lot of the good seats were marked as reseved, leaving only some good seats that were occupied and most others were pretty bad and uncomfortable to sit on. The food options were even worse off. To think this has been newly renovated. Yeesh, I need to write to American Express to make the new lounge better, because at the current state it really isn't up to the standards.
* My flight itself was uneventful but I didn't manage to adjust my body to Pacific/Mountain timezone. Since my flight out from Sydney was at 10pm, by the time it took off I was quite exhausted and I slept for majority of the flight. That meant when I landed in SF, I didn't get restful sleep at my overnight stay in Grand Hyatt and for the better part of the week I've been wide awake at 4am. It's gotten better now, but by the time I recover I think I will be back in Sydney for another timeshift...

* Immigration at SFO was ok - the usual long queue (might have been queued for an hour-ish). It's funny to say you're in AdTech, most often I hear about "oh ads suck". No different this time from the immigration officer, but the tone was mostly in jest!
* I lost my trusty Sony WH-1000XM2 headphone. Arrivals to Boulder happen in Denver, and I booked a Lyft to drop me off at my hotel. I had the headphones on me for most part of the journey and just as we were getting closer to my hotel, I kept it aside on the seat. I don't know why I did that - maybe groggyness from lack of sleep and the travel. It wasn't till the next day I realized I left the headphones. Sadly, Lyft's lost and found is pretty much "nyah nyah, you lost it, find it yourself. We can't help you". I tried to reach to the driver by email and phone, but didn't hear back. It's a shame, I've had the headphones for over 5 years now and I consider it to be one of my best purchases. 
    * I bought a replacement Sony WH-1000XM4. Why XM4 instead of XM5? It's about $100 less expensive, you get the noise cancellation and battery life as the XM5, unlike the XM5, you can still fold!
* Boulder is a beautiful city. It's also a lot smaller and more reminiscent of a small city than a big city. The city has decent-ish public transport as well. I've been taking the [HOP](https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/hop-bus) bus to get to and get back from office and been pretty happy with it. 
    * The weather in Boulder has been widly unpredictable. The first day I was in the office, there was a huge hailstorm, so much so that it looked like it'd been snowing. The subsequent days it's been raining pretty heavily.

    * This weekend, the weather's been better. I went over to Chautauqua park and it was pretty nice. Apart from being the start place for many hikes and trails, there's also a huge open space for picnics, a restaurant and a theatre. There were no events happening when I went, so I had to be content with sitting down with some coffee and soaking in the sun.

    * Besides weather, my stay in Boulder was made exciting (!) thanks to fire alarms. The first one was in the office, middle of the day. We all evacuated, thankfully it ended up being a false alarm. The next night, around midnight the fire alarms in my hotel went off. I was in a dazed state, woken up from deep sleep by the blaring alarm. In my hurry I just immediately run down, without picking up my passport/cards/slippers (yeah, went barefoot lol). Thankfully, this also ended up being a false alarm. I couldn't get a straight answer on what caused the false alarms.

* As if the events of the week were not enough, I noticed my iPad crashing and restarting every time I unlock it. I asked some of my friends if they had seen this behaviour, they told no. Booked a Genius Bar appointment, they did some diagnostics and the system stability came as flagged. Seeing that my iPad is covered under AppleCare+ (thanks to [Mike](https://failgunner.com/) for recommending me to get AppleCare+), I'll get this iPad replaced by Tuesday.
