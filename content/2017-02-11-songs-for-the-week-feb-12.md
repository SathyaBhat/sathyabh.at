Experimenting with something. Decided to make a list of few songs I enjoyed during this week's commute, one per day. Maybe do it regularly, if possible



Bear's Den - Red Earth & Pouring Rain



Chris Malinchak - So Good To Me(Radio Edit) (alternatively, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcG9lpZV24" target="_blank">full track is also good</a>)



The Morning Benders - 'Excuses (Yours Truly Session)



King Arthur feat. Michael Meaco's version of the very famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruAi4VBoBSM" target="_blank">Fatboy Slim's Praise You </a>



Alternative versions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7grf9LoOFE" target="_blank">Radio Edit</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE6q_UbzwNs" target="_blank">Original Mix</a>

Sorcha Richardson - Ruin Your Night (Official Audio)
