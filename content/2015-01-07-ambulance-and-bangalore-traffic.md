There's a well known law called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law" target="_blank">Parkinson's Law</a> which states

> work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

There are various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary" target="_blank">corollaries</a> on this - and the one which I resonate the most is

> Data expands to fill the space available for storage.

Now, if you drive on Indian roads you'll pretty much agree with this version:

> Vehicles will cram in to fill the space available on road.

I had a situation this morning where the ambulance was about 4-5 cars behind me on Old Airport Road. Right infront of HAL Police Station. The Ambulance's sirens are blaring, the driver's desperately trying to make way so that he can move on.  I have 2 BMTC volvo buses back to back on my left - first BMTC bus taken so much as of the road as to crumple me like I was nobody. An rickshaw was less an than inch infront of me(who poked in somehow from mid-lane bulldozing his way, eager to trade paint if necessary) and a biker trying to pass me from the right side with so little gap, his knee would scrape my car and he'd scream bloody murder if I just let the clutch go for a microsecond.  I wondered where and how am I supposed to give way to the Ambulance in this case. If I wait and let the Ambulance go, then I'd have heard more curses than a Bangalorean yelling at an Auto driver for demanding meter mele double at 8pm. Ultimately, I crawled on first gear till the Ambulance passed me, pretty much blocking the entire lane behind me.

Any curses were drowned by Foo Fighters' <a title="Foo Fighters  - My Hero" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqWRaAF6_WY" target="_blank">My Hero</a> coming through the Celerio's music system. Also was good to see an auto rick behind me gesturing others to move so that the ambulance can pass. Good going man.
