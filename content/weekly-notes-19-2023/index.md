### What's been happening

* I wrote a travelogue on our Blue Mountains roadtrip - if you haven't read it yet, [give it a read](/2023/05/07/blue-mountains-day-trip-travelogue/) ðŸ˜Š.
* I had no idea Google I/O was happening this week. Used to watch the keynotes religiously ðŸ˜† The Verge's got a nice 16-minute summary of the keynote. Check [it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL1w7f5o80A).
    * Pretty amazing how far along generative AI has come along, since ChatGPT made a splash. I've been trying out ChatGPT a lot more as I have mentioned the past few posts, and now Bard is open for all as well. Will be very interesting to see what new things we'll see.
* I played some more Diablo 4 this weekend thanks to the "Server Slam" - free beta testing/stress testing weekend. Tried out a shapeshifting Druid, was kinda fun! The pulverize skill has a very visceral feedback.
    * Diablo 4 release is less than a month away, I look forward to playing the release version! It'll be 11 years since the release of Diablo 3, and I had a lot of fun with D3, especially with Reaper of Souls expansion and Seasons. 
    * I managed to [defeat Ashava, the Pestilent](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1819581789) - a world boss in the upcoming Diablo 4. Well, to be more clear, it was less "I" and more the group - being a melee character, my character pretty much kept getting wrecked. It was the first time that I took on Ashava, and I'll try taking on Ashava again if possible - if not I'll just wait for the release. 
    * On that note, I must admit Diablo 4's got some really amazing music. I have spent many minutes just sitting idle and listening to the music because it is so good. Some screenshots below

* Listening to fair amount of Thai Rock music this week. Jo has been watching a lot of Thai shows, and most of them have really good songs and music. I even sat through an entire series of[ My School President](https://mydramalist.com/715931-my-school-president) because the music was so good! Of course it wasn't just the music that carried the series - have to say, the plot, many subplots, acting, chemistry between the actors - all made it a come-back-for-more series. I can see why Kdramas and Kpop have such a huge following.

* We'll be back in Blue Mountains the next weekend, and my weekly post will be delayed. Look forward to unwind and relax over the weekend!
