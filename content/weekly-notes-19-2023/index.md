### What's been happening

* I wrote a travelogue about our Blue Mountains road trip. If you haven't read it yet, [give it a read](/2023/05/07/blue-mountains-day-trip-travelogue/) ðŸ˜Š.
* I had no idea Google I/O was happening this week. I used to watch the keynotes religiously ðŸ˜† The Verge has a nice 16-minute summary of the keynote. Check [it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL1w7f5o80A).
    * It's pretty amazing how far generative AI has come since ChatGPT made a splash. I've been trying out ChatGPT a lot more, as I have mentioned in my past few posts, and now Bard is open for all as well. It will be very interesting to see what new things we'll see.
* I played some more Diablo IV this weekend, thanks to the "Server Slam" free beta testing/stress testing weekend. I tried out a shapeshifting Druid, and it was kinda fun! The pulverize skill has very visceral feedback.
    * Diablo IV will be released in less than a month, and I look forward to playing the release version! It's been 11 years since the release of Diablo 3, and I had a lot of fun with D3, especially with the Reaper of Souls expansion and the Diablo 3 Seasons.
    * I managed to [defeat Ashava, the Pestilent](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1819581789) - a world boss in the upcoming Diablo IV. Well, to be more clear, it was less "I" and more the group. Being a melee character, my character pretty much kept getting wrecked. It was the first time I took on Ashava, and I'll try taking on Ashava again if possible. If not, I'll just wait for the release.
    * On that note, I must admit Diablo IV has some really amazing music. I have spent many minutes just sitting idle and listening to the music because it is so good. Some screenshots below.

* I have been listening to a fair amount of Thai Rock music this week. Jo has been watching a lot of Thai shows, and most of them have really good songs and music. I even sat through an entire series of [ My School President](https://mydramalist.com/715931-my-school-president) because the music was so good! Of course, it wasn't just the music that carried the series. I have to say, the plot, many subplots, acting, chemistry between the actors - all made it a come-back-for-more series. I can see why Kdramas and Kpop have such a huge following.

    Check out the following songs

    and their many covers if you want to explore more! Oh and don't forget to enable the captions to see the lyrics.

* We'll be back in Blue Mountains next weekend, and my weekly post will be delayed. Look forward to unwinding and relaxing over the weekend!
