Well, I&#8217;m heading back to Austin for a second stint. Had an amazing time [the last time][1]{#aptureLink_8CR2q9PExE} I was there &#8211; was there for almost a year. Learnt a lot &#8211; technically & otherwise. Unlike last time when I had a flight from Chennai to Mumbai and then a direct Mumbai to New Jersey flight ( with a Mumbai International Airport to boot) &#8211; this time, the flight will be from Chennai.

The route would be Chennai &#8211; Doha &#8211; Washington &#8211; Austin. Worst part about this journey is that flight takes off at 04:45, and I would have to reach there by atleast 2AM &#8211; which means &#8211; Goodbye sleep. Will be reaching Doha by 06:45 for a 2 hour stopover. The connecting flight leaves Doha at 09:00 and would reach Washington at 16:00. The final flight to Austin is set to depart at 18:50. I&#8217;m a little worried about this difference &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if this difference is enough for me to finish off the formalities &#8211; especially the immigration part. Lets see how it goes. Hope it will not be anything [like the last trip][2]{#aptureLink_HZCwq0j9gr}!
