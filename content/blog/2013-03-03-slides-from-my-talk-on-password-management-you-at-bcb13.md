I&#8217;ve been going to <a href="https://barcampbangalore.org/bcb" target="_blank">Barcamp Bangalore</a> since quite a while now, and it was only at last time&#8217;s Barcamp Bangalore that I actually gave a techlash session on Automated backup. This time, I decided to give a general session with focus on how & why people people should improve their passwords & password management skills. Embedded below are my slides.



And the very next day after my talk, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Evernote gets compromised & has issued a password reset</a>. You still believe in bad password practices? Wake up, smell the coffee. Improve your passwords. <a href="https://lastpass.com/f?1603666" target="_blank">Use Lastpass</a>(disclaimer: referral link; if you signup using this, both you & me get a month of free LastPass premium. If you rather not want to use the referral link &#8211; head straight to <a href="http://lastpass.com" target="_blank">their site</a>).
