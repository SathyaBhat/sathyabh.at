<a href="http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO.htm" target="_blank">BSNL Chennai&#8217;s</a> website may claim that EVDO connections are avaible, but the reality is that they&#8217;re offering connections only in outer peripheral areas. Sad as it may be but the news is true. I&#8217;d paid a visit to the Greames Road exchange in Chennai to apply for a EVDO connection. Initially I was thrilled to see the EVDO device infront of me, all my excitement died when I was informed that there&#8217;s no CDMA tower in Triplicane, nor there is one in city. I was told that at the moment, BSNL is focussing on EVDO connections(in Chennai, atleast) only in areas where standard wired connectivity is not possible &#8211; areas like Perungudy, OMR, Velachery etc.

On asking whether any CDMA towers will be setup anytime soon, I was met with blank faces. Have to say, this isn&#8217;t the best of moves BSNL is making. There is immense response and demand to BSNL&#8217;sÂ  EVDO service and BSNL isn&#8217;t doing justice to their Chennai customers. As usual, We at BSNL EVDO Club will keep you guys updated with the latest information as and when it happens.
