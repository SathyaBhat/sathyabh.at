Generally I always carry a fair amount of cash with me, coz I&#8217;m a bit paranoid as to what might happen if I&#8217;m stranded without cash. The set of incidents which happened just now will now ensure that I will always carry cash with me.

I&#8217;d been to Hotel Balaji Woodlands for dinner &#8211; I don&#8217;t go there often, but have been there enough number of times to know that they \*do\* accept Debit cards. Now it so happened that I didn&#8217;t have enough cash with me &#8211; I had only Rs 30. Wondering whether I should goto the hotel or not, I just decided to go there. I ordered Naan and Kaaju paneer(or, kaaju curry as that was what given to me, the paneer &#8211; well they decided to eat it themselves 8-| ) . I asked for the bill &#8211; it came upto Rs. 50. Fair enough I went to the cashier and gave him my debit card to charge it to that. The next set of events left me dumbfounded. Here&#8217;s the conversation

Me: (hands over bill and ATM card)

Hotel Guy(HG): (Shakes his head)

Me: What?

HG: Rs 50.. not enough

Me: I don&#8217;t have cash. Either you accept that or you give me this meal for free

HG: (puts my ATM card into the drawer)

Me: (Getting pissed) Hello, give me my ATM card back

Waiter: You go get cash, then I&#8217;ll give card

Me: Hello? How do you expect me to withdraw cash WITHOUT my ATM card? :-w

HG: We don&#8217;t accept debit cards for small amount

Me: (Me with voice raised, and bit of temper) What kinda stupid Hotel do you run? The one which says We accept debit card, but then reject it for &#8220;small amounts&#8221;? Give my debit card back.

(Now it begins to look like a scene &#8211; there are few foreigners in the hotel, and he obviously doesn&#8217;t want the incident to be heard to all)

Finally, he gives my ATM card and asks me to pay for the dinner tomorrow. I say fine

_So here&#8217;s 50 paise to the hotel guy. I hope that amount is &#8220;big enough&#8221; to be charged to a debit card._
