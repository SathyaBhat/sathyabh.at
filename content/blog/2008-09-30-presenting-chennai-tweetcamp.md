<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">After a loong gap of about 2 and a half years, BarCamp Chennai 2[BCC2] is all set to rock your world!</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If you&#8217;re wondering what BarCamp is all about [as I was couple of months ago], BarCamp is an &#8220;unconference&#8221; &#8211; a venue where share, volunteer and participate in an open environment. The hallmark of BarCamp is that &#8211; there is no audience, all are participants! Participation can mean &#8211; giving a talk, demos, volunteering, or even blogging/twittering/podcasting/photography!</span>

The recent set of mails being sent over the mailing list has made me lose hope of BarCamp Chennai being a fun event, and is headed towards Geek/ProgrammerCamp/I-Know-Real-BarCamp shit. So while I was speaking to Narayanan, Ashish and Karthik the other day, Narayanan proposed a TweetCamp. Details being sketched out as of now, probably this post will act as a catalyst ðŸ™‚ What do you want to do in TweetCamp?
