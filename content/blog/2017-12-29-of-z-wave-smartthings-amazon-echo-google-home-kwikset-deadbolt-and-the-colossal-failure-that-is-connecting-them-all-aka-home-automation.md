This is a huge rant I sent to [Jo][1]. Some backstory: Few months back Jo bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kwikset-SmartCode-Electronic-SmartThings-featuring/dp/B004F1B24I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1514550037&sr=8-1&keywords=kwikset+910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kwikset 910 deadbolt</a> (more like I asked her to buy &#8211; hindsight I should have done more and better research) and I was trying to setup the remote locking feature using Alexa/Google Assistant via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-Smart-Home-Hub/dp/B010NZV0GE/ref=sr_1_3?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1514550067&sr=1-3&keywords=smartthings+hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SmartThings</a> Hub. Here&#8217;s a copy-paste of the entire message. I&#8217;ll have a separate post on my home automation setup.
