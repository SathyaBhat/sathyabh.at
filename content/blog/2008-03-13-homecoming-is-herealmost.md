Well the day is almost here. Have been waiting for this day for a looong time. Had planned for this more than a month ago. The D-DAY: March 18th, 2008. What's so special? Homecoming! I will be taking a long (and much deserved I might add) break from work, and will be leaving for my beloved hometown of Mangalore. It's been more than 3 months since I've been to Mangalore, and have been missing my family terribly. I'm really looking forward to meet new Neice Shriya, formerly named Saanvi.

Like I'd said, the planning for this trip was done more than a month ago. The day was chosen as Friday will be Holiday, and I would have to take leave only on Wednesday and Thursday - 2 days, and since I'm entitled to only 2 days of leave(any further and I'd be having Loss in Pay), the selection of day was just right.

I'm really looking forward to go back home -Â  relax, unwind, no worries about work or thinking anything about premiums, SQL , cursors and what not. Also looking forward to home cooked food ( ðŸ˜€ \:D/ ) - reallly missed all those sweets, and yeah Fish fry and fish curry. Yumm!Â  Here's to couple of days more in Chennai.

Cheers
