Well the day is almost here. Have been waiting for this day for a looong time. Had planned for this more than a month ago. The D-DAY: March 18th, 2008. What&#8217;s so special? Homecoming! I will be taking a long (and much deserved I might add) break from work, and will be leaving for my beloved hometown of Mangalore. It&#8217;s been more than 3 months since I&#8217;ve been to Mangalore, and have been missing my family terribly. I&#8217;m really looking forward to meet new Neice Shriya, formerly named Saanvi.

Like I&#8217;d said, the planning for this trip was done more than a month ago. The day was chosen as Friday will be Holiday, and I would have to take leave only on Wednesday and Thursday &#8211; 2 days, and since I&#8217;m entitled to only 2 days of leave(any further and I&#8217;d be having Loss in Pay), the selection of day was just right.

I&#8217;m really looking forward to go back home &#8211;Â  relax, unwind, no worries about work or thinking anything about premiums, SQL , cursors and what not. Also looking forward to home cooked food ( ðŸ˜€ \:D/ ) &#8211; reallly missed all those sweets, and yeah Fish fry and fish curry. Yumm!Â  Here&#8217;s to couple of days more in Chennai.

Cheers
