As part of Children&#8217;s day the Kannada daily Vijaya Karnataka had held an &#8220;Muddu Kanda&#8221;(translated means sweet child) contest. My sister Supriya had enrolled her daughter, my neice Shriya in the contest and guess what Shriya won the second place ðŸ˜€

Daiji World features this story. Below is the picture.

For more of my Neice&#8217;s pics you can check my flickr set.
