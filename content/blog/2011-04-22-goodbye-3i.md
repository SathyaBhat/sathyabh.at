I had tweeted these 2 simple sentences, the former about 3 months ago, the latter yesterday. Yep, after nearly 4 years, I&#8217;m moving away from 3i. It&#8217;s been an interesting experience &#8211; I&#8217;ve ranted and raved about my journeys on twitter, and often blogged about my <a href="http://sathyabh.at/tag/3i/" target="_blank">experiences and misadventures in 3i</a> ( if you have same free time, go read through the archives &#8211; good stories there). In these past (almost-)4 years, I started out as a trainee, creating patches & shipments, moved onto to GUI development using Oracle forms, switched over to backend stored procedures development using PL/SQL. Then came the big challenges &#8211; client interaction & data migration. Moving data from a 30-year old legacy system is no easy task, and with the constraints & adherence to business logic to be followed &#8211; was no doubt, the most challenging task that I had undertaken. Big props to all my colleagues, team mates, peers who helped me along and encouraged and motivated me. Also, a special Thank You to the [Ruby gang][1].

So what&#8217;s next? I will be moving over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logica" target="_blank">Logica</a>, starting Monday. I&#8217;ll still be in Chennai, though. Â Here&#8217;s for the new challenge ahead.
