I&#8217;ve been wearing contact lenses for more than 10 years now. Switched to contacts from my clunky spectacles when I started my PU(aka 11th).

When you use something for 16x7x365 (I won&#8217;t say 24&#215;7, since the lenses are off when I&#8217;m sleeping), you tend to know it inside out. And especially when it&#8217;s something like contact lenses, which sit on your eyeballs, every little change will result in instantaneous result. For instance, if you put on your lenses with an every-so-tiny speck of dirt that it&#8217;s bloody invisible, trust me, you will know about it & you eyes will water like there&#8217;s a big pump pushing out all the tears.

Anyways, all these years I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.bausch.com/en/ECP/Our-Products/Contact-Lenses/Myopia-Contact-Lenses/SofLens-Daily-Disposables" target="_blank">Bausch & Lomb&#8217;s SofLens</a> monthly disposable lenses. They&#8217;re great. Actually, scratch the great part. They&#8217;re fantastic. Fits perfectly, no shifting, no dryness nothing. If coloured lenses are your fancy, they come in various colours, but I&#8217;ve been on the stock ones, which have a light-blue visibility tint which is awesome if you ever do the scary part of dropping your lenses on the ground or in the kitchen sink.

I&#8217;ve tried some other lenses, mainly B&L&#8217;s &#8220;permanent&#8221; ones(in reality, they&#8217;re supposed to be changed every year or so), but these didn&#8217;t suit my eyes & would go bad in less than 3-4 months. Also tried Johnson & Johnson&#8217;s contact lenses, they were fine, but not as comfortable as SofLens.

Over the past few years, we&#8217;ve had HD shoved down our throats &#8211; everywhere from video to audio. Heck even FM stations started touting &#8220;HD quality radio&#8221; crap. And joining this &#8220;we have HD&#8221; queue is&#8230; \*drumroll\* B&L.  Yes. Bausch & Lomb claim their lenses have &#8220;HD&#8221; optics.

Whatever the heck **that** means. And on their webpage they have <a href="http://www.purevision2.com/demo.html" target="_blank">pretty, pretty pictures</a>(albeit served as Flash, so if you&#8217;re on a laptop, move it away from your thighs else you&#8217;ll have a Seekh Kebab down there) showing what happens when you wear their &#8220;HD&#8221; lenses. Apparently &#8220;blurred&#8221; images become crispy, squeaky clean & sharp. No more halos. Excuse me you brilliant folks at B&L PR and marketing, all those (blurred images, halos) are signs of a person wearing lenses **NOT** suited to them.

Curious to see how they actually work &#8211; I took the bait & bought them. For a <a href="http://www.lenskart.com/bausch-lomb-purevision2-hd-contact-lenses.html" target="_blank">pretty steep price</a>. Lenskart took about 10 days to deliver them. They forgot to ship the free lens solution & case which was to be included as part of the offer, but after a support ticket, they sent them to me via courier.

Been wearing these for about 2 [months now][1]. And as expected, the HD&#8217;s just marketing gimmick. Everything looks the same. And to answer those who asked me on twitter, wearing &#8220;HD&#8221; lens and viewing a &#8220;HD&#8221; movie on &#8220;HD&#8221; monitor doesn&#8217;t give you a 2160p display. Har, Har.

It&#8217;s not just the ludicrous steep price that bothers me. These lenses don&#8217;t have **any** visibility tints. Trying to find where the lenses are in the case itself is like fishing in the deep sea with your eyes blindfolded. Don&#8217;t bother searching if you&#8217;ve dropped them. While there has been no &#8220;shifting&#8221;, the lens tends to get dry a wee bit faster. And not to forget, the lens is a dirt magnet. Picks up dirt way faster than anything else that I&#8217;ve tried.

So to sum up: Don&#8217;t buy &#8217;em. HD or no HD, you won&#8217;t find any difference. And you&#8217;ll save some cash to buy another pair of lenses. Or for some shopping. Or beer. Whatever you prefer.
