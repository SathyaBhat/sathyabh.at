If you&#8217;re looking to brush up on your PL/SQL knowledge, [PL/SQL challenge][1]{#aptureLink_bTi5ZytYmL} is pretty nice. It&#8217;s a daily challenge quiz, where you are presented with Â multiple choice or true/false questions. It&#8217;s an initiative by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Feuerstein" target="_blank">Steven Feuerstein</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Feuerstein" target="_blank"></a>, who&#8217;s pretty well known. I just joined in, first few questions were not too tough ðŸ™‚ Join in, there&#8217;s [some great prizes to be won][2]{#aptureLink_WlOD3WAo4T} .

If you know of any more such websites, do drop in a comment and let me know.

(PS: If you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s with the weird URL structure, well its built on [Oracle Apex][3]{#aptureLink_rW2c7dSIBL}. Long, clumsy URLs are a pain, and Apex does nothing to banish them).
