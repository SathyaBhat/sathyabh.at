Long time, no music.. slightly occupied with house shifting and new job - but more on that later. For now, enjoy the songs

<!--more-->

"Humbug Mountain Song" by Fruit Bats -'shrooms. nuff said.



"Galactic Appeal" by Pretty Sister & Dragonette feat. Tobtok - Very old school, peppy dance song



"Walking In My Sleep" by Kris Orlowski



"Shine" by Mondo Cozmo - Church choir-esque but catchy song nevertheless



"Echo" by Incubus - yes, yes I know this isn't a new song but by golly, one of the most sublime songs I've ever heard. Instantly transports me to another world altogether



Till next time ♬
