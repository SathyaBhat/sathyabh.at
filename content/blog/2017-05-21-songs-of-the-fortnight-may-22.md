Long time, no music.. slightly occupied with house shifting and new job &#8211; but more on that later. For now, enjoy the songs

<!--more-->

&#8220;Humbug Mountain Song&#8221; by Fruit Bats -&#8216;shrooms. nuff said.



&#8220;Galactic Appeal&#8221; by Pretty Sister & Dragonette feat. Tobtok &#8211; Very old school, peppy dance song



&#8220;Walking In My Sleep&#8221; by Kris Orlowski



&#8220;Shine&#8221; by Mondo Cozmo &#8211; Church choir-esque but catchy song nevertheless



&#8220;Echo&#8221; by Incubus &#8211; yes, yes I know this isn&#8217;t a new song but by golly, one of the most sublime songs I&#8217;ve ever heard. Instantly transports me to another world altogether



Till next time ♬
