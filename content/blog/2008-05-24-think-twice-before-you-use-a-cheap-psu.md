I hang out couple of tech forums while I&#8217;m free &#8211; gives me a general idea of what hardware configuration is more or less &#8220;standard&#8221;, and one of the worst mistakes I&#8217;ve been people doing is that they COMPLETELY ignore the PSU(or SMPS, as it&#8217;s often known). I mean we&#8217;re talking about Quad Core processors, 8800GT graphics cards, hard drives in RAID and what not, only to get a cheap local, generic 500W/600W PSU, thinking the higher the wattage, the better it is for them. The problem is that these can&#8217;t deliver the current required for these high-end components, neither are they reliable or efficient &#8211; the components inside are of the worst quality.
