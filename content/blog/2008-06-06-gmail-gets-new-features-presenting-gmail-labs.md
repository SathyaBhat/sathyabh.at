One of the all-time favourite web email service providers [GMail][1] added few extra features, 13 to be exact, via the GMail labs feature. You can enable/disable anyone or all of these features by heading over to Settings -> Labs.

Note that not all email accounts might have GMail Labs features enabled.

The features include

  * Quick Links &#8211; Adds a box to the left column that gives you 1-click access to any bookmarkable URL in Gmail. Very useful feature, have enabled it. Can create a search with some criteria, and then quick link it to give a sort ofÂ  &#8220;saved-search&#8221; feature. Very useful, say If I want to find out my registered user ids in all the webservices that I&#8217;ve signed up for, just create a search criteria and put a quick link to it. Neat.
  * Superstars &#8211;Â  Adds additional star icons. After enabling this feature, you can choose which icons you wish to use in the &#8220;General&#8221; Settings page. Not using these, maybe mark those &#8220;special people&#8221; with these extra icons
  * Pictures in chat &#8211; See your friends&#8217; profile pictures when you chat with them. Hmm, maybe useful if you have friends with weird-ass userids like myself ðŸ˜›
  * Fixed width font &#8211; Adds an option to the reply dropdown menu that lets you view a message in fixed width font. Again, not using this &#8211; for sending mail to mailing lists maybe?
  * Custom keyboard shortcuts &#8211; Lets you customize keyboard shortcut mappings. Have enabled this. Very useful for a keyboard-shortcut junkie like me!
  * Mouse gestures &#8211; Use your mouse to navigate with gestures. Hold right-click and move the mouse left to go to a previous conversation, move it right to go to the next conversation, and move up to go back to the inbox view. Nice feature, have enabled this, but don&#8217;t know how long I might be using this.
  * Signature tweaks &#8211; Places your signature before the quoted text in a reply, and removes the &#8220;&#8211;&#8221; line that appears before signatures. Can&#8217;t use this and the &#8220;Random signature&#8221; Labs feature at the same time. Nice tweak, doesn&#8217;t make much difference to me.
  * Random signature Rotates among random quotations for your email signature. Can&#8217;t use this and the &#8220;Signature tweaks&#8221; Labs feature at the same time. Random signature quotes &#8211; neat idea, but wonder who reads signatures.
  * Custom date formats Adds options to the general settings page allowing the date and time format to be changed independent of language. Not using this, happy with the current formats.
  * Muzzle Conserves screen real estate by hiding your friends&#8217; status messages. Enabled this. For status messages I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">twitter</a>, thank you very much
  * Old Snakey &#8211; Kick it old school with Old Snakey! Enable keyboard shortcuts and hit &#8216;&&#8217; from the main page to play a game of snake. Who doesn&#8217;t love snake? ðŸ˜€
  * Email Addict &#8211; Lets you take a break from email and chat by blocking the screen for fifteen minutes and making you invisible in chat. Hmm, Can be handy at times!
  * Hide Unread Counts Hides the unread counts for inbox, labels, etc. Not using this, no need for this for me atleast.
