About a week ago, round about this time, my Mum called me up and and told me a piece of news which I would never in my wildest nightmares would have imagined, would happen to me.

<!--more-->

She told me that my fiancee&#8217;s family wanted to break the engagement and drop the wedding proposal. The news had me shook so bad, I was frozen at my seat for a good half hour thinking, what? Is this real? Am I imagining things? What did I do wrong? Did I insult them somehow?

I had a little bit of hope of trying to talk and fix this thing, and waited anxiously and patiently till beyond office times so that I can call her up and get things sorted.

The call happened, but things remained at status quo. Apparently the family &#8216;feared&#8217; about my leg pain(I get bouts of leg pain, especially when I walk /stand for more than 15-20 minutes, my thigh muscles hurt and I tend to limp a bit). This condition of mine feared my future in-laws and they said that they didn&#8217;t want to give their daughter to someone who &#8216;has a problem&#8217; and of the pain is like this now, they don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;d be in the future and don&#8217;t want to give their daughter to &#8216;someone like that&#8217;.

Yes, This lameass excuse is the reason for the break. I&#8217;ve also been told that they have been told that flat foot(which I have) is linked to kidney failure. I have no idea how this conclusion was reached at, neither am I aware of what other things have been put to their mind.

Whatever it is, it&#8217;s final that they don&#8217;t want this to go ahead and with the way this was brought up and done, with me treated like an unwanted piece of trash, I&#8217;m not going to go forward with this even if they want to patch up.

My birthday was last week, and the last thing I expected was for our engagement to be broken up like so.

Goes without saying it was a pretty emotional day for me, and with none of my family members around, my sister was deeply worried about me.

I&#8217;m very glad and grateful that Sharath made me stay at his place that day, with Daaku coming by for support. Talking through the day&#8217;s events with them made the transition a bit easier, and Sharath convinced me to head home for the weekend tl be with my family asap(I was originally scheduled to go a week later).

Also thanks to all those who have written, called, Emailed, dm&#8217;d, sms, whatsapp&#8217;d, fb messaged and got in touch with me offering support. It means a lot to me. Thank you.

And now it&#8217;s time to close the chapter and move on.
