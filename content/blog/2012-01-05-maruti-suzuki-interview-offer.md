Unlike other spams, this one targets the job seekers( and I can assure you, there are a \*lot\* of them). First glance a "direct job" offer looks tempting, along with the "feeling" that you are part of the "elite" few. And hey, you're getting an all-expenses paid(!) ticket for the interview.

Now if you're jumping up & down and respond immediately, you're just getting sucked deeper into the scam and in the end, you'll lose a lot and make headlines as "n candidates scammed Rs y of their cash".

If you take a second look at the email, there are signs of obvious spam.

  * "Direct offer" without being "shortlisted" (of course, if you had applied for MSIL, you might think this is real!)
  * Interview security deposit? Uh-oh
  * Account number of the **accountant** to be sent to you? Why accountant?
  * Offer letter till be sent without the job interview being completed? Why hold the interview then?
  * Offer letter will contain date of interview? Okaay..
  * The horrible language, grammar, lack of punctuation(although, I'll admit - I've seen call for interview letters with bad grammar too)
  * Ah yes, the live.com email address(why not MSIL's domain?) and yes the blatantly incorrect spelling for Maruti in the email address.

Goes without saying, if you get this email - don't respond, don't reply cursing(F&#^ YOU! YOU'RE SCAMMING!) - hit the report spam option.

Meanwhile, I'll have to check if there's a way to report an email as spam from outside the webmail client&#8230;
