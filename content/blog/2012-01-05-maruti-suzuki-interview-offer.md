Unlike other spams, this one targets the job seekers( and I can assure you, there are a \*lot\* of them). First glance a &#8220;direct job&#8221; offer looks tempting, along with the &#8220;feeling&#8221; that you are part of the &#8220;elite&#8221; few. And hey, you&#8217;re getting an all-expenses paid(!) ticket for the interview.

Now if you&#8217;re jumping up & down and respond immediately, you&#8217;re just getting sucked deeper into the scam and in the end, you&#8217;ll lose a lot and make headlines as &#8220;n candidates scammed Rs y of their cash&#8221;.

If you take a second look at the email, there are signs of obvious spam.

  * &#8220;Direct offer&#8221; without being &#8220;shortlisted&#8221; (of course, if you had applied for MSIL, you might think this is real!)
  * Interview security deposit? Uh-oh
  * Account number of the **accountant** to be sent to you? Why accountant?
  * Offer letter till be sent without the job interview being completed? Why hold the interview then?
  * Offer letter will contain date of interview? Okaay..
  * The horrible language, grammar, lack of punctuation(although, I&#8217;ll admit &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen call for interview letters with bad grammar too)
  * Ah yes, the live.com email address(why not MSIL&#8217;s domain?) and yes the blatantly incorrect spelling for Maruti in the email address.

Goes without saying, if you get this email &#8211; don&#8217;t respond, don&#8217;t reply cursing(F&#^ YOU! YOU&#8217;RE SCAMMING!) &#8211; hit the report spam option.

Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll have to check if there&#8217;s a way to report an email as spam from outside the webmail client&#8230;
