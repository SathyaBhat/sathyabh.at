Have you ever seen the &#8220;contact forms&#8221; that are present on a lot of companies offering services such as Broadband, Telephone Lines, cars, bikes et al?  
I have and I&#8217;m sick of seeing them. Why do these dumbasses put these forms? They are of no utility except for the sole purpose of harvesting email address, phone numbers & other contact details so that they can shove their promotional material down your throat and spam you to eternity.  Over the past couple of years that I&#8217;ve seen and used them &#8211; with zero response, I wonder why in the hell do they keep it at all. Absolutely zero response.

The culprits so far:

  * Airtel (telephone, Broadband)
  * Reliance (telephone, Broadband)
  * Tata Teleservices (Broadband)
  * You Telecom(Broadband)
  * Maruti ( car)
  * Ford (car)
  * Hyundai (car)
  * Volkwagen (car)
  * Honda (car)
  * Fiat (cat)

  Heck Volkswagen haven&#8217;t bothered getting back to me, yet have nicely subscribed me to their promotional crapware that gets deleted straightaway(oh thank thee, <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/gmail/gmail-smart-labels-classify-bulk-emails.html">GMail filters</a>). (<strong>Update: </strong>Volkswagen gave me a call today, <strong>nearly  a year</strong> after I had filled in their online inquiry form. Are they freaking insane? Call up after a <strong>whole freaking year?) </strong>

  To give Ford some credit, one of their dealers did call me and setup a test-drive & then conveniently forgot about arriving for the test drive. Way to go, Ford!

  If you don&#8217;t have the basic decency to pay a little attention to your customer who&#8217;s investing truckloads of money in you, you should STFU and not talk about customer care. At all.

  And for Christ&#8217;s sake, get rid of those useless request forms.
