We&#8217;re on double digits! Let me know how you like the songs! &#x1f3b6;&#x1f3b5;

Start with &#8220;Stay in&#8221; by JAWS. Released in 2012, the song has a very 90s feel



Next is &#8220;Flightless (Jody Wisternoff & James Grant Remix)&#8221; by Kyson. First heard on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/anjunadeep" target="_blank">Anjunadeep</a> the song is a wonderful piece just right to relax



&#8220;Drop&#8221; by Lycoriscoris &#8211; Another great track I&#8217;d heard on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/anjunadeep" target="_blank">Anjunadeep</a>.



Up next, &#8220;We Went&#8221; by Randy Houser &#8211; Action packed video which matches the lyrics very well!



To wrap up for this week, &#8220;Woman Woman&#8221; by AWOLNATION. I promise I didn&#8217;t see the video when I had selected this song!
