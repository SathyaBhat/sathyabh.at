I was living at home, but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after making love, we heard the<br /> Telephone ringing downstairs. I suggested to my girlfriend that I give her piggy-back ride to the phone. Since we didn&#8217;t want to miss the call, we didn&#8217;t have time to get dressed. When we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights<br /> Suddenly came on and a whole crowd of people yelled &#8220;SURPRISE!? My entire family, uncles, grandparents, cousins and all of my friends were standing there! My girlfriend and I were frozen to the spot in a state of shock and embarrassment!<br /> For what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no-one in my family has planned a surprise party again. </span></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></span><!--more-->[ad]

I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told her<br /> That if she didn&#8217;t start behaving herself right now, she would be punished. To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as threatening, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I saw you<br /> Kissing Daddy&#8217;s pee-pee (d@#k) last night!? The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped what they were doing! I mustered the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in<br /> tow. The last thing that I heard as the door closed behind me was the screams of laughter. </span></span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br /> </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #993300; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #993300; font-family: Verdana;"><br /> </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And the Winner Is&#8230;&#8230; </span></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: blue; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: blue; font-family: Verdana;"><br /> First place </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #993300; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #993300; font-family: Verdana;"><br /> </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #993300;"><span style="color: #993300; font-family: Verdana;">This one actually happened at Harvard University in October last year. In a biology class, the professor was discussing the high glucose levels found in semen. A young female (freshman), raised her hand and asked, &#8220;If I understand what you are saying, there is a lot of glucose in male semen, as in sugar?&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s correct.&#8221; responded the professor, going on to add much statistical data. Raising her hand again, the sweet young thing asked, &#8220;Then why doesn&#8217;t it taste sweet?&#8221;. After a stunned silence, the whole class burst out laughing, the poor girl turned bright red and as she realized exactly what she had inadvertently said (or rather implied), she picked up her books without a word and walked out of the class, and never returned. However, as she was going out of the door, the professor&#8217;s reply was a classic. Totally straight-faced, he<br /> answered her question, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t taste sweet because the taste-buds for sweetness are on the tip of your tongue and not in the back of your throat! &#8220;</span></span>
