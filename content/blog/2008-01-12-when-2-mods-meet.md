I&#8217;ve been posting on [Tech2 forums][1] for over 8 months now(strictly speaking according to my join date, it&#8217;s been more than a year but I was active from April onwards) & I&#8217;ve made some good friends with fellow techies. I always wished to meet up with them. Last month, my wish came true. You see, Reetesh(another Moderator at tech2) had informed me couple of days ago that he&#8217;ll be on a trip to Tirupathi and will not be online. The previous day I received a mail from Reetesh telling me that he&#8217;ll be visiting Chennai and asked me if we could meet on Dec 25. I immediately replied back saying that we could meet up. Unfortunately I had to work on 25th, and I thought I wont be able to meet up, but finally Reetesh and me met up at Spencer&#8217;s Plaza. We had a nice time, discussing about all things techie&#8211;the current state of forums, the newest games, the latest trends, certain idiotic users, what&#8217;ll be condition of forums after the recent TV-18 group taking over Infomedia(Publishers of CHIP magazine) and things non-techie, about how life goes on etc. Reetesh tried his best to obtain Guitar Hero, but was unsuccessful in getting it&#8211;we tried all shops, Landmark, music world, small shops which sell original and Pirated Games. And yeah my sense of directions(or lack of it, ðŸ˜• meant that we must&#8217;ve circled the same area over 5 times ðŸ˜¯ (Reetesh, remember Pantaloons, CD Byte?? LOLOL) Overall it was a really nice experience! Hope to meet more people!
