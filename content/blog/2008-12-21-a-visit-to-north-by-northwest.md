The day I landed in Austin, when I was being driven back, I&#8217;d seen this seemingly nice place &#8211; North by North West and my colleague told me its a beer brewery and restaurant, and I made a mental note to check it out. Somehow I never checked it out &#8211; till today. Yesterday while heading out to Bank of America to encash my Travellers&#8217; Cheque I noticed that North by NorthWest is pretty close and walking distance from where I stay, so I decided to check this place out.

Now me being a beer fan there was no way I was gonna miss out on going to this place. Though its mentioned as a &#8220;Restaurant and Beer Brewery&#8221; its really more of a beer brewery plus bar, they were few tables &#8211; it was more of a &#8216;Bar-stool-table&#8217; sort of a thing. Its a good place for you to come with your buddies.

The place&#8217;s got bunch of HDTVs&#8217; which would be great for watching the football games which would be on air.

Being a beer brewery they&#8217;ve got some of their own brewed beer &#8211; I had couple of Northen Lights &#8211; its basically a light beer with a hint of groundnut taste. &#8216;t was pretty nice. Also had Chicken Albedo Pasta &#8211; which is basically Pasta plus Chicken plus Onions and Red Capsicum. overall food was ok, the service wasn&#8217;t upto the mark &#8211; but then with only 2 bartenders serving you can&#8217;t expect much.

Anyways if you&#8217;re a beer lover and in Austin, do drop by North by Northwest. Its at 10010 Capital of TX Hwy N  
Austin, TX 78759.
