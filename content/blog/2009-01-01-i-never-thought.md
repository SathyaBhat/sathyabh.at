Its almost time to kick out 2008 and welcome 2009. Instead of posting the Happy New Year message, thought I&#8217;ll post somethings which I never thought/expected I&#8217;d do/happen but did: So here ya go

<!--more-->

  1. Never thought I&#8217;d go from busy to jobless and extremely busy and working overtime in a matter of couple of hours.
  2. Never thought I&#8217;d such a huge twaddict (that&#8217;s twitter addict for you lesser mortals)
  3. Never thought I&#8217;d be a BarCamper
  4. Never thought I&#8217;d conduct 2 twitter meetups (however tiny they may be)
  5. Never thought I&#8217;d see quite a lot of my friends and colleagues get laid off
  6. Never thought I&#8217;d be having a 5KB/s Internet connection
  7. Never thought I&#8217;d organize 2 tweetups
  8. Never thought a fucking useless nobody Reports manager would be a Senior Manager
  9. Never thought I&#8217;d see an AGM get sacked overnight and asked never to return
 10. Never \_ever\_ thought I&#8217;d be asked to come onsite
 11. Never thought the AWESOME Mumbai tweeps would wait for me at the Mumbai Airport Gate and would have a tweetup just before I left
 12. Never thought I&#8217;d set my foot in US in this year
 13. Never thought I&#8217;d witness snowfall in an area where snowfall almost never comes
 14. Never thought I&#8217;d taste/have more than 5 different types of handmade Beer at the same location
 15. Never thought I&#8217;d see a Lesbian couple next to me in a bar
 16. Never thought I&#8217;d see a Viagra ad on mainstream TV
 17. Never thought I&#8217;d speak and get so close to a girl I&#8217;ve never met before

To cap it all, never thought 2008 would be such an eventful, packed, thrilling, rollercoaster ride of a year..

Goodbye 2008, Â Wish you all a Happy New Year All!
