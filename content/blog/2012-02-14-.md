<img class="alignright" title="Mass Effect 3 Logo" src="https://cache.techie-buzz.com/images4/Kaz/ME3logo.png" alt="Mass Effect 3 Logo" width="205" height="205" />It&#8217;s been a long wait for Mass Effect fans and the wait is over. At least, for the demo version, that is. BioWare just announced that the demo of Mass Effect 3 is now available to download.

Mass Effect 3 is the final chapter in the Mass Effect series of games which marks Commander Shepard&#8217;s fight against race against the Reapers. Mass Effect has easily been one of the most anticipated games of the year. Initially slated to be released towards the end of 2011, the game was delayed to &#8220;tweak things&#8221;.

The demo will feature both single-player and multiplayer options &#8211; with some portions of the multiplayer being initially locked.

The single player section features the opening level featuring the Reaper attack on Earth, and a level further into the game where Shepard travels to an alien home world to seek their assistance in the war effort, while the co-op multiplayer section will include 2 maps: Slum and Noveria. This section will be open to players who have qualified for the early multiplayer access as of February 14, and will then open up to all players on February 17.
