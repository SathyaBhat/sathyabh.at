Well on March 19th, 2008 I turned a year older&#8230;.(wiser? pfft). It was a nice day, as I landed in Mangalore on that day from Chennai. I&#8217;d taked a flight from Chennai to Bangalore on the previous day, followed by a train from Bangalore to Mangalore(my post on my Maiden Flight Journey got lost in teh InterWebs :(( ) However the train was delayed by 1 and half hours, which resulted in me reaching home at 10, instead of the usual 8:30. I was with my family, after being away from family for 3 months it felt good! My phone was busy all day with sms and calls wishing me(my phone bill will be high this time, as I was on roaming while answering the calls and replying to the sms). I also got loads of Birthday wishes on Orkut, Chip forums and on twitter(thanks guys for the wishes!). That evening I went to the temple, followed by a trip to a Hotel called Trshna. Food was kinda ok, but it was a nice outing. The past 1 year has been extremely fruitful, about a year this time ago, I was nearly down the dumps, whole loads of backlogs(aka KT&#8217;s), aggregate nowhere near to what is called &#8220;acceptable limit&#8221;. Lots have passed since then &#8211; cleared all my backs, got a distinction, a job off-campus at 3i. Here&#8217;s hoping the coming year will be even more fruitful.

Cheers
