It's been more than 7 years since I last [built my home desktop](https:///sathyabh.at/2013/08/01/hellforge-my-desktop-after-a-long-time/). It hadn't remained static - there had been a [steady trickle of updates](https://sathyabh.at/) over the years but the base foundation:

<!--more-->

- the processor
- motherboard
- cabinet 

remained the same. Although the processor I had (Core i5 3470) wasn't exactly top-of-the-line back then, it had still enough horsepower, especially coupled with the GPU (nVidia Geforce 970, replaced later with the Geforce 1080) to crunch anything that I could throw at it, VR included (check my [previous post](https://sathyasays.com/2017/11/05/a-brief-look-at-the-oculus-rift/) for my impressions of the Oculus Rift).

### Hellforge and the Bajaj Chetak Problem

Last year, my desktop developed a weird problem where if I cleanly turned off the system after a shutdown, the system would not POST upon subsequent startup. Resuming from sleep, however, was not a problem - if the system was shutdown (due to power outages/manually shut down via Windows), however, 9 times out of 10, the system would just not post. Once a bluemoon, however, something would happen and it would start. Once running, everything would work just fine. Bizarre as it sounds, it did happen. I called this as the Bajaj Chetak problem. For those who didn't get the reference, this is how you would start a [Bajaj Chetak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaj_Chetak).

I was so annoyed by this problem that I bought a UPS so that the system never shuts down! I reached out to [Abhay](https://twitter.com/ALPHA_Ronin) so see if he could figure out what's happening - but alas, even Abhay couldn't figure out the problem.

This was the closest I had come to rebuilding the desktop. However, with the Bucharest move coming soon, I didn't want any unnecessary expenses prior to the move. One weekend, Abhay, Jo and me took the motherboard and RAM to SP Road and we asked couple of shops for suggestions on where to fix Motherboard issues and they all pointed to that one shop - MSR Computers. This place is so obscure, you can't even find it on Google Maps, but is located just above [Ankit Infotech](https://g.page/AnkitInfotech?share). Barely 5 minutes of the technician connecting a debug module, he told us there was problem in the memory controller(I think? I can't recall) and asked us to return in 2 hours and it will be fixed - and for a grand total of Rs 2,000. Brilliant. And here I was preparing to spend about 30x of that amount.

### Hellforge, Remastered

With my [Romania move finalized](https://sathyabh.at/2020/01/08/salut-bucharest/), I decided not to take my entire desktop and sell it off in India, with the exception of the GPU and few other peripherals. Once I was all settled in Bucharest, moved into my new house, I started looking at what to buy. With Abhay's help, I finalized these specs:

- Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600
- Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Elite X570 
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 3200MHz
- Cabinet: CoolerMaster Masterbox MB511
- PSU: Corsair RM650
- Monitor: ACer Nitro VG271UP 27", WQHD(1440p, 144Hz)

I bought from a variety of sources, depending where I got the best price - Processor & Motherboard from [PC Garage](https://www.pcgarage.ro/), Cabinet from [evoMAG](https://www.evomag.ro/), RAM, PSU from [eMag](https://emag.ro) and the monitor from [Altex](https://altex.ro/). The rest of the components I carried over from my old PC:

- EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 SC GAMING ACX 3.0
- Keyboard: Corsair K70 Lux
- Mouse: Corsair Glaive
- Logitech C270 webcam

Since I didn't have a lot of space on the desk, plus the fact that the Acer Nitro monitor has a really, really, [really bad stand](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/aybrqj/review_of_the_acer_nitro_vg271up/), I decided to get a [SBOX LCD 352-2 monitor arm](https://www.pcgarage.ro/suport-tv-monitor/sbox/lcd-352-2-13-27-inch/) from PC Garage.
