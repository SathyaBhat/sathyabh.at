### Hellforge and the Bajaj Chetak Problem

It's been more than 7 years since I last [built my home desktop](https:///sathyabh.at/2013/08/01/hellforge-my-desktop-after-a-long-time/). It hadn't remained static - there was a [steady trickle of updates](https://sathyabh.at) over the years but the base foundation:

- the processor
- motherboard
- cabinet 

remained the same. Although the processor I had (Core i5 3470) wasn't exactly top-of-the-line back then, it had still enough horsepower, especially coupled with the GPU (nVidia Geforce 970, replaced later with the Geforce 1080) to crunch anything that I could throw at it, VR included (check my [previous post](https://sathyasays.com/2017/11/05/a-brief-look-at-the-oculus-rift/) for my impressions of the Oculus Rift).

Last year, my desktop developed a weird problem where the system would not POST if it was shut down. Resuming from sleep, however, was not a problem - if the system was shutdown (due to power outages/manually shut down via Windows), however, 9 times out of 10, the system would just not post.  Once a bluemoon, however, something would happen and it would start. Once running, everything would work just fine. Bizarre as it sounds, it did happen. I called this as the Bajaj Chetak problem. For those who didn't get the reference, this is how you would start a [Bajaj Chetak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaj_Chetak).


I was so annoyed by this problem that I bought a UPS so that the system never shuts down! Even Abhay couldn't figure out what was happening. 

This was the closest I had come to rebuilding the desktop. However, with the Bucharest move coming soon, I didn't want any unnecessary expenses prior to the move. One weekend, Abhay, Jo and me took the motherboard and RAM to SP Road and we asked couple of shops for suggestions on where to fix Motherboard issues and they all pointed to that one shop - MSR Computers. This place is so obscure, you can't even find it on Google Maps, but is located just above Ankit Infotech. Barely 5 minutes of the technician connecting a debug module, he told us there was problem in the memory controller(I think? I can't recall) and asked us to return in 2 hours and it will be fixed - and for a grand total of Rs 2,000. Brilliant. And here I was preparing to spend about 30x of that amount.
