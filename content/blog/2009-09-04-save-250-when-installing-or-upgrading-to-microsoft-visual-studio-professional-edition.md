Welcome to Sathya's first ever giveaway! So you want to get your hands on Visual Studio Professional edition, but find the pricing a little steep ? Here's a nice way to save $250!

First the basics:

<!--more-->

  1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition (new purchase) price: $799
  2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition (upgrade) price: $549
  3. Microsoft Visual Studio 2008: Express Edition price: **FREE**

Here's the kicker:

> To **qualify for upgrade pricing, you must be a licensed user** of an earlier version of Microsoft Visual Studio or any other developer tool (**including** **free** **developer tools, such as Visual Studio Express Editions or Eclipse**).

So - here's your $250 off! Install Visual Studio Express Edition and then upgrade it to Visual Studio Professional Edition, **saving $250 off ¬†instantly**! Now wasn't that easy?

As on [Microsoft's page][1] and [MSDN forums][2].

PS: Yes, I'm back in India. Will update soon üòê

PPS: You can use Express Edition and save $800 - ¬†but thats according to your requirements
