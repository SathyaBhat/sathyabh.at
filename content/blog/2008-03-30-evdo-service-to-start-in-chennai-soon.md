while surfing through <a href="https://chennai.bsnl.co.in" title="Chennai telephones" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chennai telephones</a> site, I came across an interesting web page: [https://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO.htm][1] This is indeed good news for me, and for those people who can&#8217;t just go for a wired connection now(read my reason as to why i cant get a wired connection <a href="https://sathyasays.com/myworld/2008/01/19/my-laptop-chronicles-obtainingor-trying-to-obtain-a-bsnl-evdo-connection-part-1/" target="_blank">here</a>). While a web page announcement is a good thing, whether it&#8217;ll change the ground reality &#8211; that of lack on information among BSNl employees about EVDo, anytime soon will remain to be seen. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://sathyasays.com/myworld/2008/01/19/my-laptop-chronicles-obtainingor-trying-to-obtain-a-bsnl-evdo-connection-part-1/" target="_blank">previously</a> <a href="https://sathyasays.com/myworld/2008/02/17/of-handling-multiple-projects-and-failed-evdo-connections/" target="_blank">blogged</a> about my hassles in trying to obtain \*information\* about an EVDO connection. Let&#8217;s hope this time around I get better news and feedback. I will keep you guys informed about happenings as and when I get the latest updates
