You guys should be knowing about what&#8217;s been happening in Mumbai all this while.

If not, a brief round up on twitter, Wikipedia, by Aditya and Kunal Sheth.

Photos and videos speak better than words so here&#8217;s Vinu&#8217;s flickr profile and of course, Aravind&#8217;s Magnum Opus, Hash Mumbai.

[edit]

Saket aka Vulturo speaks his mind out.

Vijayendra Mohanty writes an open letter to the media and gets a response.

Chetan Kunte on some \*excellent\* journalism that I mention below.

[PS: Got more links? Drop a comment, I&#8217;ll add]

[/edit]

Salute to all the Brave Police, Army Men, NSG Commandos, ATS guys. Without you guys, we would be nowhere.

Politicans &#8211; meh. I&#8217;ll save my breath, they aren&#8217;t worth it.

Reporters: Great job, especially on giving out VITAL information like where the Commandos are stationed and what not /sarcasm.
