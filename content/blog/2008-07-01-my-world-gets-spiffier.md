Yup, if you&#8217;re reading this you obviously must have noticed the new theme for my blog, My World. I&#8217;d been using a slightly modified version of [Seven theme][1], since the inception of My World. I really liked the theme, but it was [kinda broken][2], and with AdBlock Plus addon my blog had a rather bland appearance.

[Santosh][3] told me its about time I changed my theme but I wasn&#8217;t getting enough time to search for a decent theme, as I&#8217;ve been [facing rather][4] strict deadlines [off late][5]. Santosh was also kind enough to search this fantastic theme, though he&#8217;d given it to me a while ago, I couldn&#8217;t get time to change it. Today, our office servers [were down][6], and I thought this is a perfect time to dress my My World, and so here you go!

I think I&#8217;ll have to modify a bit more though &#8211; the links in the tag cloud aren&#8217;t picking the CSS value for links for instance. (I&#8217;m open to suggestions also by the way), and as you might have noticed, there&#8217;s a ticker of screenshots being displayed. Its rather generic now, but I&#8217;ll probably change it to something. In case you guys want something to be displayed, drop me a comment as to what you want me to display(and maybe a why too ðŸ˜‰ ) and I&#8217;d probably fill-it in.

So how do you like the new theme? Drop by a comment and let me know!

Cheers!
