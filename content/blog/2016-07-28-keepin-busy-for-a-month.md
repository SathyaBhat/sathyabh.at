So when I <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2016/07/12/in-with-the-new-job/" target="_blank">resigned from CGI</a>, I thought I&#8217;d have to stay through the entire 2 month notice period with the org. However, since there was no dependency on me, I was hoping for an early release and thankfully that did happen. I initially thought of joining the new job right away but decided to take a month-long break from work and relax for a month.

A month seemed quite a lot, however the days went by so fast I didn&#8217;t even realise that my break was over. So here&#8217;s somethings I did to keep myself busy(few of those I had been meaning to do since a long time, never got around to doing it)

  * The first week was pretty much devoted to completing a freelance job I had with SAP &#8211; <a href="https://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials/webide-github-creating-org.html" target="_blank">to write a 6-part tutorial series on how you can use SAP Web IDE and Github for collaborative development</a>
  * I also spent a fair amount of time in playing/completing games that I had been meaning to since a while: Tropico 4, <a href="https://sathyasays.com/2016/07/12/review-of-supergiant-games-transistor/" target="_blank">Transistor</a>, Just Cause 3, Journey, Pillars of Eternity, Broforce, Uncharted 3 and few more
  * Realised how much working at home without a power backup would be a pain because of BESCOM&#8217;s sustained powercuts(couple hours almost daily, if not more)
  * Became what Jo calls, &#8220;house husband&#8221; &#8211; do housework ie get fruits/veggies, chop &#8217;em, do the dishes some laundry(they seem so easy.. took couple of hours easy)
  * Cleaned the wiring clutter in our house, esp the one around my desktop. Bought <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Inventis-Fastener-Computer-Management-Organizer/dp/B011BQNJ18?ie=UTF8&tag=mewoof-21&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01" target="_blank">1m of velcro</a>, used it to tie around lose cables coming from the landline, Ethernet cable from Act, tons of wires coming from/behind the desktop. It&#8217;s not quite pretty, but still loads better than how it was before.
  * More cleaning, this time inside the desktop cabinet, tied up wires coming from PSU(which is not modular) and replaced the fan which came with the cabinet(which are incredibly noisy) with <a href="https://www.amazon.in/BitFenix-Spectre-Blue-120mm-Computer/dp/B005ZQRDVI?ie=UTF8&keywords=bitfenix%20spectre&tag=mewoof-21&qid=1469703629&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1" target="_blank">BitFenix Spectre</a>. I&#8217;ve been replacing each of the fans in the cabinet with this one, they are pretty silent and for the lighting fanatics, they&#8217;ll leave your eyes dazzled.
  * Went on a 1,800km roadtrip across coastal Karnataka and Goa(will post travelogue soon)
  * Did some light reading for upcoming new role
  * And lots of sleep, especially thanks to above mentioned powercuts by BESCOM

Overall, it was a good one month break which went by way faster than I imagined!
