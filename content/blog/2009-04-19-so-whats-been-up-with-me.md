Its been a while since I posted eh&#8230; oh yea been busy with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">lots of stuff</span> just work :|. Lot has happened, so let me get started.

<!--more-->First, yap I&#8217;m still in Austin &#8211; I was scheduled to make a return to India in 

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">January</span> March &#8211; well that didn&#8217;t quite happen &#8211; I&#8217;m still here &#8211; and would most probably return to India during the end of May &#8211; don&#8217;t think this would get postponed &#8211; might just cause a problem when I return (yes there&#8217;s a high chance that I might return).

Celebrated my birthday alone üôÅ but had lot of wishes on twitter and facebook &#8211; thanks for the wishes ya&#8217;all!

Also couple weeks ago went on a shopping spree(atleast to my standards!). Me and a colleague of mine had been to [San Marcos][1]{#aptureLink_ZanRA4XZBP} &#8211; there&#8217;s a factory outlet strip mall here of quite possibly ALL the brands you could think of &#8211; and this place is pretty huge. Just browsing here could easily take a day. God bless your poor soul (and wallet/credit/debit-card/bank account) if you&#8217;re here with a shopoholic wife/GF/BF/fiance. Bought myself a GAP shirt, a GAP flip-flops (sandals üòõ ), bunch of halfsleeved shirts, T-shirts(including a frikkin&#8217; awesome &#8220;Rock on handsymbol&#8221; T-shirt and a Tee featuring all of Marvel comics characters, couple of Banana Republic T-shirts, and yea pair of Nike shoes (guess no trip to US would be complete without a &#8220;flashy&#8221; I-bought-in-US-sports shoes &#8211; don&#8217;t worry I stuck to a simple pair of sports shoes &#8211; I hate the flashy gimmicky ones.

Work&#8217;s killing me as always &#8211; no pont in discussing that.

Appraisal season was upon in office &#8211; I was told that my Appraisal would be done by a Chennai manager &#8211; a guy who I&#8217;ve never worked with, neither does he who the hell I am üòê great job. Thankfully it was changed, but again to other fellow who doesn&#8217;t know me well. And that fellow actually gave me a 3/5 rating. Yes after all the headbanging, after all overnighters, all the upto-2AM-wake-up-at-6AM stuff, I get a three, gee, thank you very much for keeping me motivated \*more\* than ever-before.

Although I&#8217;m not \*that\* concerned with the rating &#8211; the clients here have given me excellent feedback(&#8220;you are the most eloquent person who&#8217;s come here&#8221;) and the fact that my onsite PM and Delivery manager have both appreciated my hardwork &#8211; their feedback has had a postive impact on me &#8211; the fact remains that the 3 rating still pricks me a bit. I&#8217;m a human([and a PC too][2]{#aptureLink_LtjxlTjK6Y} &#58;&#80;) after all.

Next is a piece of news about couple of my friends that rattled me &#8211; one of my colleague/batch/friend was asked to leave &#8211; part of the whole layoff thing. Another guy would be leaving work &#8211; he&#8217;s gotten an admission for MBA &#8211; Shankara &#8211; The Godfather &#8211; you ROCK! All the best for your MBA and the future ahead of you! My roomie &#8211; Adi &#8211; is getting engaged to another batchmate &#8211; I told all of my friends this is going to happen &#8211; nobody believed me (heck I&#8217;m his roomie &#8211; I \*know\* what the heck he&#8217;s been talking after all :roll:) &#8211; congrats to him as well. Might not be able to meet them üôÅ Shankar would be probably leaving around May 15 &#8211; and Adi&#8217;s going to Nigeria for couple of months next weekend. Great stuff.

Next &#8211; I tweeted about going to Smackdown event &#8211; Smackdown was here at Frank Erwin centre but work meant I couldn&#8217;t go :(( DAMMIT! :((

Also been trying out Jaunty &#8211; and loving it &#8211; check my impressions [here][3]{#aptureLink_LLSwpYpIdb}.

What next &#8211; well as mentioned above I might return to India May end ([tweetup at Int&#8217;l airport again][4]{#aptureLink_b3yqIxxUbX}, [Aalaap][5]{#aptureLink_IiDPV3ytzE} ? &#58;&#80;). Means I can be with my sis for her b&#8217;day in June üôÇ

Maybe a tweetup with [Sindhu][6]{#aptureLink_9MLmMrDR2v}, [Manish][7]{#aptureLink_rnP8CT4mgv}, [Swaroop][8]{#aptureLink_MP1Tlyvmgk} ? lets see! Will keep ya all posted!

Cheers till then!
