Its been a very busy, hectic past few months. Besides my <strike>day</strike> night job( I work at US timings, PITA), I‚Äôve also <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/author/sathya" target="_blank">started contributing</a> to <a href="http://techie-buzz.com" target="_blank">techie-buzz</a>, though my <strike>day</strike> night job takes a whole lot of my time, and I‚Äôve not been able to contribute much. My <a href="http://sathyasays.com/" target="_blank">Linux blog</a> and as well as this blog has been lying almost in a coma state. I plan to start posting some articles now and then, got it in shipshape with a new theme, so watch out!&#160; I‚Äôm still pretty active on <a href="http://twitter.com/sathyabhat" target="_blank">twitter</a> ( again, not as active as I used to be ‚Äì even with my ‚Äúlow‚Äù activity I keep getting requests not to spam the timeline &#58;&#112;). I‚Äôve been fairly active on posterous though. 

I started using tumblr as <a href="http://tumble.sathyabh.at" target="_blank">my tumblelog</a>, but switched over to <a href="http://post.sathyabh.at" target="_blank">posterous</a>. The primary reason for switching over was at that time, tumblr was incapable of handling multiple attachments ‚Äì it‚Äôd post the first attachment and discard the rest. Started looking for alternatives, and posterous caught my eye. Its unbelievably amazing how simple posterous is. Just send an email to <post@posterous.com>, and you‚Äôre done. That‚Äôs it. That floored me over. 

I‚Äôve been actively involved in Web communities for quite some time,&#160; and now time constraints mean that current my involvement is at Chip forums where I‚Äôm the <a href="http://www.chip.in/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=31003" target="_blank">Super Moderator</a> and at <a href="http://superuser.com" target="_blank">SuperUser</a>( <a href="http://superuser.com/users/4377/sathya" target="_blank">with rep of 7.1k</a> ) ‚Äì The StackOverflow for Power Users. I also lurk around in <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Meta</a> ‚Äì there are some good discussions over there. When I get some time, just drop by <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> and <a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED</a>.

Coming back to real life, as mentioned I‚Äôve been pretty deeply involved in work, and come this Wednesday, I‚Äôll be taking a break for about 10 days ( after a span of about 5 months, I believe). Initially, the break was meant just for the weekend ‚Äì the plan was to head to Thrissur, Kerala and then hop back to Chennai. I decided to extend the plan,&#160; and head over to Mangalore to take a break. Deepti, Ankit & the rest proposed that we meet up at Cochin for the weekend,and so it was settled. So, currently the plan looks like:

Jun 23rd: Chennai to Thrissur

Jun 24/25: Thrissur to Cochin

Jun 25 ‚Äì Jun 27: Cochin

Jun 27 ‚Äì Cochin to Mangalore

Jun 28 -&#160; July 4th: Mangalore 

Will be good to take a nice break. Hope I don‚Äôt calls regarding work, my experience says I will get it :/ 

Got nothing planned in Mangalore, lets see how it works üôÇ
