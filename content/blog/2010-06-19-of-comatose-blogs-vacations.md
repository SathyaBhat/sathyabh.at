Its been a very busy, hectic past few months. Besides my <strike>day</strike> night job( I work at US timings, PITA), I’ve also <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/author/sathya" target="_blank">started contributing</a> to <a href="http://techie-buzz.com" target="_blank">techie-buzz</a>, though my <strike>day</strike> night job takes a whole lot of my time, and I’ve not been able to contribute much. My <a href="http://sathyasays.com/" target="_blank">Linux blog</a> and as well as this blog has been lying almost in a coma state. I plan to start posting some articles now and then, got it in shipshape with a new theme, so watch out!&#160; I’m still pretty active on <a href="http://twitter.com/sathyabhat" target="_blank">twitter</a> ( again, not as active as I used to be – even with my “low” activity I keep getting requests not to spam the timeline &#58;&#112;). I’ve been fairly active on posterous though. 

I started using tumblr as <a href="http://tumble.sathyabh.at" target="_blank">my tumblelog</a>, but switched over to <a href="http://post.sathyabh.at" target="_blank">posterous</a>. The primary reason for switching over was at that time, tumblr was incapable of handling multiple attachments – it’d post the first attachment and discard the rest. Started looking for alternatives, and posterous caught my eye. Its unbelievably amazing how simple posterous is. Just send an email to <post@posterous.com>, and you’re done. That’s it. That floored me over. 

I’ve been actively involved in Web communities for quite some time,&#160; and now time constraints mean that current my involvement is at Chip forums where I’m the <a href="http://www.chip.in/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=31003" target="_blank">Super Moderator</a> and at <a href="http://superuser.com" target="_blank">SuperUser</a>( <a href="http://superuser.com/users/4377/sathya" target="_blank">with rep of 7.1k</a> ) – The StackOverflow for Power Users. I also lurk around in <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Meta</a> – there are some good discussions over there. When I get some time, just drop by <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> and <a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED</a>.

Coming back to real life, as mentioned I’ve been pretty deeply involved in work, and come this Wednesday, I’ll be taking a break for about 10 days ( after a span of about 5 months, I believe). Initially, the break was meant just for the weekend – the plan was to head to Thrissur, Kerala and then hop back to Chennai. I decided to extend the plan,&#160; and head over to Mangalore to take a break. Deepti, Ankit & the rest proposed that we meet up at Cochin for the weekend,and so it was settled. So, currently the plan looks like:

Jun 23rd: Chennai to Thrissur

Jun 24/25: Thrissur to Cochin

Jun 25 – Jun 27: Cochin

Jun 27 – Cochin to Mangalore

Jun 28 -&#160; July 4th: Mangalore 

Will be good to take a nice break. Hope I don’t calls regarding work, my experience says I will get it :/ 

Got nothing planned in Mangalore, lets see how it works 🙂
