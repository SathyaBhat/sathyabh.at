I&#8217;ve been looking for a reliable VPN client, one which works well on Windows Vista / Windows 7 and especially one which can connect to a IPsec&#8217;d Cisco VPN.

Of course there&#8217;s Cisco&#8217;s default VPN client but the one given to me is a crappy old 4.6 version, and works only on Windows XP. Tried to get the AnyConnect version, but after PITA registration and deep digging into a hopelessly unnavigable site, found that I cannot download it using a &#8220;standard&#8221; registration account :-\

Anyhow, I&#8217;ve been using ShrewSoft&#8217;s VPN Client for now, its pretty neat,  user  friendly(well, unless you&#8217;re trying to create a new connection anyway) , works great and can import Cisco&#8217;s pcf profile files as well, saving you the trouble of having break your head in configuring one.

So, go grab it now!

(PS: Haven&#8217;t yet tested the Linux version, will post on my [Linux blog][3]{#aptureLink_ObOpQxvspc} after trying it out)

Update: [Swaroop][4]{#aptureLink_gE9qZNl4QN} just [informed me][5]{#aptureLink_bu2lfXzq8o} about Cisco&#8217;s [WebVPN][6]{#aptureLink_OR8Qkket7j}. Neat stuff, but requires additional config from Net Admins.
