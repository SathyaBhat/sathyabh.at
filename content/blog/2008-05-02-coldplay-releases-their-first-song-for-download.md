Well first it was [Nine Inch Nails][1] offering their single Discipline for free [download][2] and now [Coldplay][3]  
[ad]  
has taken the same route, offering their single &#8220;Violet Hill&#8221; from their New album &#8220;[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends][4]&#8221; forÂ  free [download][5].

Enjoy the song, it&#8217;s awesome. Cant&#8217; wait for their album.
