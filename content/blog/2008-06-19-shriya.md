Yup, that&#8217;s my neice, Shriya and her mum, my sis Supriya. Shriya now pretty much looks like my brother-in-law. I&#8217;ve been saying this since day 1 but then there was a slight bit of my sis&#8217;s look in her. but now she&#8217;s got nary a look of my sis in her. Hope to get to meet her soon.

Been a while since, I&#8217;ve been to Mangalore, ast time I&#8217;d gone here was in March. With Shriya&#8217;s first birthday coming up in August, I hope I can get a week long leave to be with her duringÂ  her b&#8217;day.
