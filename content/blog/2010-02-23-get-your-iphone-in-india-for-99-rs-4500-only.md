_Note: This is something I had stored on_ [txtb.in][1]{#aptureLink_oJ6QnmJrj2}, _long, long ago.

  Here we go.

  OK</p> 
  
  <p>
    YOU CANNOT GET iPHONE FOR 99-FREAKKING-DOLLARS.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Comprende ?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong> I hear you say but, but its on the Apple website</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ooook. See the little (1) next the price ? Well read it:<br /> Let me put it here:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Requires new <strong>two-year AT&T wireless service contract</strong>, sold separately to qualified customers; <strong>credit check</strong> required; must be 18 or older. Existing AT&T customers who want to upgrade from another phone or replace an iPhone 3G should check with AT&T or use http://www.apple.com/iphone/buy to find out if they are eligible for early upgrade pricing: $299 (8GB), $399 (16GB), or $499 (32GB) with a new two-year contract.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Still, no?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unlike India, you don&#8217;t (rephrase: 99% of people don&#8217;t) purchase the phone outright. The $99 = downpayment.<br /> The rest of the cost is covered in monthly phone bill. The average per month bill is around (lets assume load it with everything), $120. Again, its an average. It might be more, it might be less. Do some math.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    $99 + 120*24 = ???<br /> NOT FREAKING $99!<br /> Yes, it&#8217;s $2979. That&#8217;s the cost you&#8217;ll have to bear.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oooo, I&#8217;ll break the contract. Erm. Nada.<br /> Break the contract within a month = you <strong>have</strong> to return the phone.<br /> OK, I&#8217;ll wait. There&#8217;s something called early termination fee: it goes upto $175.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ok, $99 + 175 = $275 = YAAY! WIN!!!!!<br /> Erm, down boy. You <strong>can&#8217;t</strong> break the contract <strong>that</strong> easily, not unless you have a <strong>valid</strong> reason.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OOoh, I&#8217;ll report stolen and get it.<br /> Wake up, this ain&#8217;t India where you can get an FIR done in 5 bucks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oooh, I&#8217;ll purchase and leave the country.<br /> Um, Let me bring up the terms again.<br /> <strong>credit check</strong> required.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Credit check = based on your SSN. SSN will reveal anything and everything about you. You default, when you come back, there will be whole bunch of whoop ass on you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OK? Any questions ?
