Zac Saber&#8217;s Soak Up The Sun : Some lovely guitars and harmonica



Hunck&#8217;s Never Had a Dream &#8211; some incredibly transcending electronica/sob rock



Rynn&#8217;s Islands: Incredibly relaxing song



Sam Roberts Band&#8217;s TerraForm: Another great song that&#8217;s not been heard much



and rounding up for this week is Ghost&#8217;s Square Hammer. Funky video and great music to boot. Bonus feature: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(Swedish_band)" target="_blank">Read up on the band</a>. Not your usual stuff.



Till next week!
