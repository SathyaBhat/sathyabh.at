You know very few people know my full name. Most people call me as &#8220;Sathya&#8221;, my twittter friends &#8220;SathyaBhat&#8221;. Mainly that&#8217;d would because I&#8217;ve never mentioned it &#8211; not because of &#8220;privacy reasons&#8221; or I have a name which would cause certain problems &#8211; its just that it&#8217;s sorta too long &#8211; I mean who wouldn&#8217;t prefer calling &#8220;Sathya&#8221; to &#8220;Sathyajith Bhat?&#8221;.

Now that I&#8217;m here in US &#8211; I&#8217;ve had to further shorten my name. I mean I didn&#8217;t expect people to pronounce &#8220;Sathyajith&#8221; (trust me they tried, tried and were like &#8220;Saaa&#8211; I give up??&#8221; ). Well people have had problems calling my shortened name &#8220;Sathya&#8221; &#8211; I mean here they ask your name for everything &#8211; whenever you other something at the restaurant etc,Â  and everytime I say &#8220;Sathya&#8221; people would be like &#8220;pardon me?&#8221;. So from Sathyajith Bhat to Sathyajith to SathyaBhat to Sathya &#8211; now its SJ.
