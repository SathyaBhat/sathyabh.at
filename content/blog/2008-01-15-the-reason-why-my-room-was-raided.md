Well in my previous post I&#8217;d posted that my room was &#8220;visited&#8221; by cops. [Few][1] [people][2] had even suggested reasons: Drugs, porn, while my assumption was that it was because of hookers. Well I got the update from the Guest House manager, and nope. It wasn&#8217;t for drugs. Not for porn. Not for hookers. Not for piracy either.  
The reason? [THIS][3]. üòê  
Apparently there was a tipoff that Mr. Modi would be killed and that his assassins were already in Chennai. Hence the &#8220;tight&#8221; security. _So by launching raids at 2:00 AM at all possible guest houses, just few hours before Mr. Modi would land in Chennai, they could detect and find the assassins?_  
As [Preshit][4] would so, here&#8217;s 50 paise to the extremely &#8220;tight&#8221; and efficient security system of cops.
