Attending an interview tends to be a scary, nerve-wracking event for most, me included. It&#8217;s like college exam 2.0 &#8211; you don&#8217;t do anything building up to the event, panic & do a splash and dash the previous night(though in my case, it&#8217;s more like &#8220;ah, fahgettaboutit&#8221;), start wondering and worrying what&#8217;s about to be asked prior to the event, with your mind racing about &#8211; &#8220;what if x comes, oh shit I forgot about y&#8221;, the big moment where you stammer, blabber and spit out something and then keep worrying till the results are out.

Last week, I got a call from the HR team asking if I&#8217;d be available and willing to come to office on Saturday. The reason? We had a weekend hiring drive and they wanted me(among others) to be an interviewer. My first reaction was &#8211; &#8220;mm okaaay but I&#8217;ve _never_ done this before&#8221;(though never is not true, I did take up an interview, but that was for my team & was more of accompany-the-project-leads-and-ask-a-few-questions). This case, however, was different. It&#8217;d be a face-to-face interview. With people willing to join the organization. I decided to say Ok. Hey, it&#8217;d be a different experience.

Some time later, I realized that I needed to prepare &#8211; you don&#8217;t want an Interviewer who goes blank in front of a candidate!  Now deciding what to prepare, how to prepare was a challenge. The candidates I was to interview would be having a work experience of about 1-2yrs &#8211; and at that stage most candidates would barely know anything.  After speaking to few colleagues and friends I decided to prepare a &#8220;set list&#8221; of topics to talk about.

Come Saturday, I started for office, reaching at 10:00, even though I&#8217;d been asked to come only at 10:30. At first sight, there were a lot of people &#8211; I&#8217;d say about 100-or so. Some time later, most of the other Interviewers came in. I met the other Oracle interviewers. The candidates had to undergo a written test first, followed by a communication round.

The candidates who cleared both were sent into the lion&#8217;s pit &#8211; to us. For most candidates &#8211; I started off by asking them to tell me about themselves &#8211; the intention is to figure out how well they can speak. After this, I asked about what they did in their earlier workplace &#8211; the intention being to try to understand what work they&#8217;ve done so far. Most candidates spun tall tales about doing x,y, z and so on. Finally, I asked them how much they would rate themselves in their skill sets. Once again, most candidates rated themselves as 4/5 in most.

Once I started interviewing them, however, I ended up sighing and face palming so many times, I lost count. I had a candidate who&#8217;d mugged up their entire project source code & when I asked for a simple query, much like writing an exam, come out the vomit of their mugged up program &#8211; including front end validation which I&#8217;d never asked for &#8211; neither would work when run on the database! There was another candidate, who claimed to have almost 2 years of experience, but didn&#8217;t know a bit of database triggers, or transactions/commits/rollbacks. Probing a little deeper indicated what I had inferred when interviewing them &#8211; all paper experience with nil real world application. Most of the other panelists had the same experience.

In the end, I interviewed 4 candidates, taking an average of about 40 minutes per candidate & ended up rejecting 2. Overall it was an interesting experience. Would definitely take up the opportunity again.
