It's been a while since I posted anything, so lets get this started again. As I had tweeted couple of weeks back, I have moved to Bucharest, Romania.

So some of the obvious questions would be:

- Why Romainia?
- How did it happen?

Let's take on them one by one:

### Why Romania?

To which I say why not? I've been looking at moving out for a while now, and the US was never an option, especially with the current visa situation(and Jo not being able to work with a dependent visa). Europe is what Jo and me had been looking at since a while. I've been working with my colleagues from Bucharest, Romania since past couple of couple of years and this gave me a chance to bring up a internal transfer request within my team. With the approvals in place, we were finally able to start the process. However, as with immigration & inter-country transfers, this was just the start of a long road of lots of paperwork and documentation shuttle.

### How did it happen?

Immigration and work visas are never easy, and Romania's visa/work permit process wasn't a piece of cake either. Before the visa process could begin, I had to get a work permit - which can be only done by the employer. And for applying the work permits, I had to get a "Criminal Record" aka PCC/Police Clearance Certificate, Transcripts from my University, my Degree certificate and my previous experience certificates - and I had to get them [Apostilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_Convention) too!

One of the many TIL moments was about Apostille.. 

> A certification under the terms of the Apostille Convention is called an apostille (from Latin post illa and then French: a marginal note) or Hague Apostille. It is an international certification comparable to a notarisation in domestic law, and normally supplements a local notarisation of the documen

The good thing was most of these were well calatalogued and saved(I have almost everything digitised with multiple backups) and the ones that needed to be done, namely the transcripts and PCC, I could apply for these online. 

- [PCC](https://portal2.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/docAdvisor/pccPassport)
- [Transcripts from VTU](http://vtu.ac.in/en/online-fee-payment/)

For getting the documents Apostilled, I went to [Superb Enterprises at Infantry Road, Bangalore](https://goo.gl/maps/fkF2PqWp7394S5Ci8). I visited them the first time solely on the basis of Google reviews and then kept going back(I had to get the documents apostilled multiple times, especially the PCC due to delays in paperwork) because I really liked the service. They also gave a link where I could follow the status of the document - which is fantastic for someone who's _just a little bit_ paranoid like me.


### The Embassy Rant 

The work permit took about a month, from the date of application to collection, other delays such as sending documents to Bucharest, Romania resulted in a much longer time frame though - close to about 3-4 months). Once I had the work permit, it was time to apply for the visa. Here's when things got a lot more painful: Romania has just one embassy for all of India, Bangladesh, Nepal. It gets better: it's in Delhi. Even better: they accept documents only from 10 am to 12 pm, and used to be closed for collection on Wednesdays(this is no longer the case, however). From my previous experience with the Embassy, although the visa application is to be submitted online, you still need to visit the embassy with the originals. Even worse, the submitting the documents online doesn't give you an appointment date, and the application submission at the embassy used to be on a first-come, first-serve basis. This meant the first time I went to the embassy 2 years back, I was at the embassy at 6 am (even though the time for document submission is not before 10 am), standing and waiting outside. Thankfully, this is changing now - first-come, first-serve is no longer encouraged and the people at the embassy ask for people with appointments and interviews first and only when interview and appointment pool is done, they ask for others. 

However, this bit of information is still not well known and the embassy website still encourages first-come, first-serve - and if you follow this, like me, you'll just end up wasting a whole lot of time. Another pain point is that even though the embassy now encourages visiting only after getting an appointment, there doesn't seem to be any automated way of getting an appointment - when I visited the embassy and stood for hours, the embassy official noted my file number and scheduled for an appointment for 5 days later. I wonder if/when I would have gotten the appointment, had I not gone and stood at the embassy - especially since the work permits are time bound - ie, the visa application for the work permit must be done within 2 months of the work permit being approved else it excpires and a new work permit must be applied for - which needs a new PCC because that also has a limited eligiblity window - you see where this is going?
