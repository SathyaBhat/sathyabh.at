If you&#8217;re ever stuck in a situation where you need to contact Bank of America from here in India, but don&#8217;t have International outgoing available, here&#8217;s a quick tip:

  * Check out AT&T&#8217;s [Direct Access Dialing Code for India][1](at the time of writing this, it&#8217;s 000117)
  * You&#8217;ll reach an Operator. Tell him/her the number you want to Dial. This should be <a href="tel:602.597.2395" target="_blank">602.597.2395</a> for Bank of America. Will be different for others.
  * You&#8217;ll be prompted to Enter Calling Card number. Skip entering anything
  * You&#8217;ll be asked if you want to initiate a Collect Call. Say yes.
  * Done.

This **should** work with any organization which uses AT&T and accepts Collect Call, but I haven&#8217;t tried with others. I&#8217;m writing here because I want to document this for my future use.

This will come in real handy especially in situations where BoA detects Irregular/Fraudulent card activity and wants you to verify the transaction by dialling in &#8211; but you have no way of reaching out to an International number. Have your card number & other details ready
