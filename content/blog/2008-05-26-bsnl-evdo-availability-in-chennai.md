I&#8217;d **<a href="http://sathyabh.at/2008/04/19/bsnl-evdo-to-be-available-in-chennai-only-in-outer-peripheral-areas/" target="_blank">posted previously</a>** that as of now BSNL EVDO is available only in the outer peripheral areas of Chennai. This is now verified by BSNL&#8217;s Chennai Coverage page, which shows the areas in which BSNL EVDO service is available and what can be the expected speeds.

Thanks to Gigacore from **[BSNL EVDO Club][1]** who posted this news over **<a href="http://bsnlevdoclub.com/bsnl-evdo-coverage/bsnl-evdo-coverage-in-chennai/" target="_blank">here</a>**.

So my wait for the connection continues. Hope theyÂ  can get some towers erected in Triplicane area. But then that&#8217;s wishful thinking.
