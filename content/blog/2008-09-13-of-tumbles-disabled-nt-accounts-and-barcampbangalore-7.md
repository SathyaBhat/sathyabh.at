I&#8217;ve finally done it. Been contemplating it for a while, but past couple of days&#8217; turn of events have made me do what I&#8217;ve been contemplating about. What am I writing about? My tumblelog of course!

I get lots, I mean LOTS of email forwards. Those subscribed to my forwards mailing list would say I send lots of forwards. But then I forward only the best of the lot, and that&#8217;s like maybe 10% of what I get. But then couple of days ago, my office NT user account (and not just mail account) was disabled by the mail network admin, citing &#8220;Mail misuse&#8221; 😐 After running from pillar to post, getting approval mails from group head, phone calls to the network admin, apologizing and three-quarters of a day lost productivity, was finally able to get my NT account re-enabled, and me decided not forward anymore. But still I wanted to share those forwards. I&#8217;ve been trying WordPress&#8217;s blog-by-email feature, but was unable to get it running on my Google Apps&#8217; mail id. 

Tumblr seemed a nice way of sharing these forwards, and though I&#8217;d signed up for tumblr couple of weeks back, I&#8217;d never used it. So I decided to wipe off the dust, and launch it! The result -> Ta daah! [Sathya&#8217;s Tumbles][1] (yeah I know corny name, but WTH). I&#8217;m still waiting for the A records propogation to be through, and once that is done, my tumblelog will be available at <http://tumble.sathyabh.at/>. I&#8217;ve also enabled Disqus comments for my Tumblelog, so feel free to comment 🙂 [on a side note, I&#8217;m seriously considering integrating Disqus with my WordPress blogs]. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;read-only&#8221; mode of my tumblelog at <http://sathyabh.at/tumblelog> which just displays my tumblelog posts, adapting my blog CSS, which looks neat 😀

Next &#8211; Barcamp Bangalore 7 is here! Though I won&#8217;t be able to attend day 1 of Barcamp Bangalore due to clash with my working days, I will be there for day 2. I&#8217;m really excited to attend, since this will be the first ever Barcamp that I&#8217;m gonna attend. I&#8217;ve signed up as Volunteer over there, will be blogging and obviosuly tweeting about it as well. Looking forward to meeting Santosh(@9_6), Laxman(@scorpion032), Ashwin(@cruisemaniac), Prashanth(@hnprashanth), Ashish(@mataal) and LOT more of tweeters! So see you all there! 

And just as I was about to leave from office, I was chatting with [Kunal Sheth][2] over GTalk and he told me that he&#8217;s going to be in Bangalore on Monday, so that just about about made my day &#8211; I do hope Kunal can spare some time and we could catchup &#8211; it&#8217;ll be awesome if we could.

So then see ya all in Barcamp!
