Being a mini &#8220;celebrity&#8221;  can be a problem. Now I&#8217;m no &#8220;celebrity&#8221;, but being a moderator of India&#8217;s biggest tech website forums, [Tech2.o][1] has its advantages&#8230;and drawbacks too. Some of the people who contact me on IM, just make me go =)) =)) =))

Case in point was the other day, while I was working, I get buzzed on IM. A guy asks me, &#8220;are you the moderator at tech2?&#8221;. I say &#8220;yes&#8221;. He tells me: &#8220;&#8221;prove it!!&#8221; I was like WTF?, and I go &#8220;Why should I?&#8221;. He then goes :&#8221;I KNOW YOU ARE LYING&#8221;. I then go &#8220;Ughhh, Ok, fine. I see no reason as to why I should &#8220;prove&#8221; you anything&#8221; . I&#8217;m like jeez what losers. Unfortunately I didnt have teh ENTIRE log of that conversation to share with you guys.
