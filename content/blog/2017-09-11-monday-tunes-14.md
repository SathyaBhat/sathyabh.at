&#8220;Goodnight&#8221; by Shoffy &#8211; this is probably the first song that I really like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2bWoRWc3AD9Dv2IZTa6MaN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the version on Spotify</a>(which I suspect is the orignal) but YouTube doesn&#8217;t have this one. I&#8217;m going to link another one for YouTube but if you can &#8211; do listen to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2bWoRWc3AD9Dv2IZTa6MaN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one on Spotify</a>
