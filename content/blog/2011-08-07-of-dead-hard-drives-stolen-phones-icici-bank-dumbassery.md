It’s been a bad, bad week for couple of my gadgets. First, my 500GB internal laptop drive, which I had <a href="http://sathyabh.at/2011/03/29/installing-the-kingston-v100-ssdnow-128gb-ssd-on-a-hp-envy-14/" target="_blank">swapped out for a Kingston 128GB SSD</a> and converted into an external drive, crashed. It is my fault, tbh – I had disconnected it before sleeping the previous night and next day morning, after waking up, breakfast et al decided to listen to some music & plugged in the drive to the USB port. 

Unfortunately, I was standing up and the moment I plugged the drive in, the USB drive slipped from my hands and fell on the ground, just as the drive had spun up to it’s maximum speed of 7200 rpm, instantly killing it. I plugged it back in, with little hopes of it being alright, but listening to the sounds confirmed what I had feared – the drive was dead, making the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_of_death" target="_blank">click of death</a>. The data loss was minimal – most important documents were on <a href="http://db.tt/OL4QOga" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, Pictures on <a href="flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat" target="_blank">flickr</a>, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/thecoolpcguy" target="_blank">Picasa</a>, <a href="http://post.sathyabh.at" target="_blank">Posterous</a> & Dropbox. Bulk of the hard drive was populated with data from my previous install of Windows, which I meant to clear up but never bothered. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any backup of my Music – so I’ll have to redownload them again. I’ve been using <a href="http://last.fm/user/sathyabhat" target="_blank">last.fm</a>, Grooveshark or Spotify (depending on my mood |) pretty extensively, so I’m not too heavily hit by the loss of my music collection. And with me using last.fm to scrobble all of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/sathyabhat" target="_blank">my listened music</a>, my entire music library is available online. 

Another data which comprised the bulk of the data on the hard drive were the installed games that I had <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/sathyabhat" target="_blank">purchased via Steam</a> – I’ll have to redownload these again but I’ll do them as and they’re needed.

That was on the start of the week. This Thursday, however I faced the most significant loss – my <a href="http://sathyabh.at/tag/nexus-s/" target="_blank">beloved Nexus S</a> – was stolen while boarding the bus. Anyone who’s known me or met me knows how possessive I am about my phone – don’t let it go out of my hand. I was heading back home from work, waiting for the bus to come. The bus was crowded, more than usual. I hesitated at first on whether or not to take the bus, bus considering that I had been waiting for half hour, decided to board the bus. While climbing, some dude bumped into me. Once in the bus, after I paid for the bus ticket, I decided to listen to some music and \*wham\*. That sickening feeling of knowing that your phone’s no longer there hit me. I asked a lady standing next to me to give a call – but it was coming as switched off. And bear in mind all this happened within a span of 10-15 minutes. 

The thief flicked my phone, switched it off, tossed out the SIM within that period. \*sigh\*. I didn’t have any tracking apps installed either to make things worse. My first concern was that the thief would try to delete my contacts, and since contacts are sync’d to my Google account, they would be deleted from there as well, so I rushed over and changed my password. Since I use LastPass premium, I also revoked access to the app. 

For now, I purchased a second hand iPhone 3GS from <a href="http://twitter.com/shivaranjan" target="_blank">Shivaranjan</a> – ideally I would have gone for the Nexus S again(yes, I love that phone!) but it was out of stock on Flipkart. Knowing Shiva would have a phone or two as backup(!) I DM’d him if he was willing to sell any of his Android phones, he said negative but offered me the 3GS.

If these 2 incidents weren’t enough, ICICI was there to fuck up things even further. I had opted for an upgrade to my debit & credit cards(both were due to expire soon) about 2-3 weeks ago. This week, I finally got my debit card. ICICI nicely informed me that they would send over the PIN for the debit card in another postal mail for “security reasons” – this would take another 7 or so days. While that was fine, these dumbasses also deactivated my existing debit card, which meant I couldn’t withdraw from the ATM, all this while I’m due to pay rent for my room. And with my phone stolen, I couldn’t even get the phone banking to work – it would reject my account number and report that the debit card entry was invalid. 

Finally after a lot of head banging, I managed to get the debit card activated. 

To top it off, Airtel decided to take their own sweet time in reactivating my replacement SIM request. Yeesh. Hope at least the next week turns out to be a little bit better.
