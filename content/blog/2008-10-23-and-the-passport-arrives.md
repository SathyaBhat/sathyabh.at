After running about the Mangalore passport offices, running behind the cops to get verification done, and running to Bangalore passport office and converting the passport application to Tatkal, I finally received my passport in Chennai yesterday.

It wasn&#8217;t all smooth sailing though &#8211; I could&#8217;ve gotten it a LOT earlier but Ayudha Pooja, Vijaya Dashami, holidays caused the Passport application processing to be delayed by a week.  
<!--more-->

  
To add to the complications, I had to apply for the passport in Mangalore I don&#8217;t have any valid address proof for my Chennai residence though I&#8217;ve been here for more than a year. And though we have a passport office in Mangalore, we can&#8217;t convert it to a Tatkal quota passport, meaning after applying for the passport and waiting for the police verification, I had to goto Bangalore to submit the Tatkal conversion application, and pay the Tatkal fee. And there was another catch here.

I reached the Bangalore passport office, it took me about half hour to figure out which Queue to stand in &#8211; (FYI: There&#8217;s an Enquiry queue, passport application queue and a Tatkal conversion queue &#8211; most people standing in the queue didn&#8217;t know what queue they were standing in) and another 2 and half hours to actually get to the counter &#8211; no thanks to stupid idiots who&#8217;d keep barging in, and other because of fucking agents who&#8217;d carry 10-20 applications. The worst part was that the counters are open from 9:30 to 12:00, and I got to the counter at 11:30, only for him to tell me that the police verification report hadn&#8217;t been received by them üòê So effectively that day was wasted, and had to wait another day, and thankfully by the next day I was able to submit the application head back to Chennai.

Further delay was because the Passport would be sent via Speed Post to Mangalore (since my permanent address is my M&#8217;lore address) and my Dad had to send it Chennai again, using Speed Post. Oh well, its finally here, and my Visa processing has started already.

Work-wise its getting pretty hectic, since now majority if my team mates were layed off (and as of today shifted to a new geography), which means only few remain, and I&#8217;ve been having Daily KT sessions &#8211; as most senior people will be resigning from office this weekend. So in addition to KT sessions, currently I&#8217;m also dealing with some change requests, working on new requirements and fixing bugs to the things I&#8217;d worked on üòê that leaves me pretty much dead tired by the end of day.

Ah well, I guess that&#8217;s about it for now. Will post soon as my Visa is ready.

Cheers
