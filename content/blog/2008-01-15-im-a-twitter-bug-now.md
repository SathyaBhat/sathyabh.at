[Preshit][1] had introduced me to [twitter][2] a while ago, but I&#8217;d never bothered to check it(don&#8217;t ask me why). Seeing twitter updates on Preshit&#8217;s blog, I thought I&#8217;d give it a try. After trying it out, I&#8217;m cursong myself &#8212; for not having tried it earlier!

In case you guys are wondering, twitter uses the concept of microblogging, where you send short updates of upto 140 characters(or &#8220;tweets&#8221;) to Twitter&#8217;s [website][2], via SMS, using IM(only Jabber-based protocols like GTalk are supported at the moment). The updates are displayed instantly.  
Believe me, you you start using it, you&#8217;ll get hooked on to it immediately. And you dont even have to logon to their site, you can update the status using Snitter (which uses Adobe&#8217;s [AIR][3] technology). FireFox users can also use the [TwitterFox][4] add-on. There&#8217;s even a KDETwitter plasmoid for those using KDE4.0 Although I&#8217;ve been using only for the past couple of days, I admit, I&#8217;m a twitterbug now and totally hooked onto twitter&#8211;keep updating status via GTalk, Snitter, KDETwitter, and even using my Cell Phone(though not through SMS as of yet), via GPRS. Highly recommend you guys to try it out! You&#8217;ll like it!
