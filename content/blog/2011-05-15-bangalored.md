&#8230; for a fortnight, that is.

Although, I was not  _strictly_ <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=define%3A+bangalored" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bangalored</a>, barely a week <a href="http://u.sbhat.me/ePAVaF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after joining Logica</a> I was asked to come over for Bangalore for 2 weeks for some training sessions. Now since this was a company sponsored training, my travel and accommodation was handled by them.

Reached Bangalore on Sunday, May 1st morning via the Jan Shatabdi Chennai-Mysore train at <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/14367096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10:45am</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/ashwinsid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashwin</a> was kind enough to come over to the railway station to pick me up. Headed over to At-home Guest House at Koramangala, which was to be my place of stay for the duration of the visit. With no agenda being set, Ashwin & Me were wondering what be the next thing to do. Ashwin & Me remembered Ashwin Murali ( “Cruise” to avoid any confusions”<img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout" style="border-style: none;" src="http://sathyabh.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png" alt="Smile with tongue out" /> ) tweeting about TGIF having reopened in Royal Meenakshi Mall, and that’s where we decided to move next.

In true twaddict fashion, we sent a tweet about a tweetup at TGIF and we were joined by DKris & Fossil. Daaku was supposed to come but cancelled last minute due to some heavy rains. Santosh & HNP also cancelled since it was too far away from where they stay. We spent a good 3-4 hours there, discussing about anything and everything over pitchers of Beer & Mojitos, and some excellent food. Needless to say, it was one of the best meetups that I’ve had. Although we were supposed to meet Santosh & HNP at Guzzlers, we decided to cancel that because of the distance.

The rest of the week went about in traditional clockwork style – met up with my new team mates ( as of now, I’m the sole member of my Project in Chennai, rest are in Bangalore). I did get a chance to meet up with my engineering classmates Prasad, Sharath & Sadanand though – it was nice catching up with them.

Also managed to pay a visit to see my nephew Neel – I’ve been meaning to visit the every time I paid a visit to Bangalore but something or the other always came up.

The upcoming weekend on Saturday was spent with another tweetup, this time at <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/734560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Egg Factory</a> with Ashwin, Arun(aka mixdev), Sameer Panchangam & Deepak. With Arun carrying his D500, Ashwin decided to apply his creative genius and <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/arunvijayan/Eggfactory?authkey=Gv1sRgCMrVl_SFlZPbUA#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take some nice pictures</a>.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="EggFactory" src="http://sathyabh.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/EggFactory_thumb.jpg" alt="EggFactory" width="244" height="164" border="0" />][6]

Sameer also took a pic of the 4 Samsung phones that were on display in the shape of Google’s Nexus brand

We headed over to UB City after that for… actually I have no idea what for<img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-disappointedsmile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://sathyabh.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-disappointedsmile.png" alt="Disappointed smile" /> We just needed to do some time pass I guess.

After roaming about aimlessly in UB City, we decided to drop by Naturals icecream before calling it a day.

Over the second week I was a little bit more swamped with work, and the days flew by really fast. Before heading back to Chennai, met up with Neeta & Sujith over at Forum.

For my return trip, I wasn’t able to get a train ticket (full, as usual) so took a KSRTC AC sleeper bus. Ashwin had come to pick me up, and after settling the Guest House dues, we headed over to Bobby Ganesan<sup><a href="#footnote_0_507" id="identifier_0_507" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Barbeque Nation">1</a></sup> only to find that the place was totally reserved ( even though 99% of the tables were empty). Ashwin suggested we head over to Olio’s and we proceeded there. The food was pretty OK ( quantity was rather sad though).

) and since we had asked for a pitcher of Beer, some KingFisher folks were around, and they told us that we were eligible to tear open a voucher for a surprise gift – which ended up being a Cricket bat keychain.

Anyhow, it was a nice 2 weeks in Bangalore – not sure when I’d back back there again. Before signing off, I wanted to make a note – Bangalore used to be a place where trees used to quite common – even within city ( heck it was known as the Garden city)

However, now, sights like these are very rare.  
(sorry about black bands)
