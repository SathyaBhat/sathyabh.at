Ever since I&#8217;ve known [last.fm][1] via Amarok, I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of that site. Today I was going through Build last.fm, which consist of community generated Scripts, stats, plugins and some extras &#8211; and was just playing around with some of the apps.

Here&#8217;s some of them-  
PS: Bandwidth intensive post ahead! You&#8217;ve been warned!

Badges: Some badges to show my play count

Certificates & Diplomas:  
![Diploma][7] 

Get it from [here][8]

Wallpapers:

Naa, these aren&#8217;t your ordinary wallpapers, these wallpapers are generated by analysing the songs you&#8217;ve scrobbled, and wallpaper is generated which is a mash-up of your top50 albums! Cool eh!

Here&#8217;s a pic of it:

You can get it from [Last.fm Wallpaper Generator][9]

There&#8217;s also an offline version, available [here][10]

On a similar note, there&#8217; also a albumart signature generator for Forums, which is dynamically updated.  
![AlbumArt Signature][11] 

Get it from [here][12]

Then there&#8217;s [MoneyCalc][13], which tells you how much it&#8217;d cost for you to purchase the Top50 albums.

(Just FYI, My music archive is worth: 853.40 $)

And finally, there&#8217;s Lastfm Caroussel Quilt for Top10 Albums listened To, which you can get from [here][14]
