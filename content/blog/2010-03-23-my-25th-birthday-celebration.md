March 19 1985, 05:28. Date and time a certain SJ (no, not Steve Jobs, [me][1]{#aptureLink_cm5348bQ3b}!) came into this world. Fast forward to March 19, 2010. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Today.</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Yesterday</span>. couple of days ago. 25. I&#8217;ve &#8220;officially&#8221; completed 25 years of which 22 years were spent in [Mangalore][2]{#aptureLink_nUtmkwPZQR}, 9 months in [Austin][3]{#aptureLink_7txdYQLi6P}, and the remaining time in [Chennai][4]{#aptureLink_qHryz2Xwgy}.

The day was pretty uneventful, however. My colleague Sweety was the first to call at 12:00, and Zakir, the silent assassin sitting besides me jumped and pounced on me, hammering away &#8211; all in the name of &#8220;bumps&#8221;. Few more calls, \*loads\* and \*loads\* of tweets and facebook messages wishing me a Happy B&#8217;day. I actually hit twitter rate limit, on xtw.in and dabr, twice. Dang. Finished off my work ( I&#8217;m a zombie, work at nights thanks to my [previous stint][5]{#aptureLink_TkHKk8Na1e} \*grumble\*grumble\* ) left for home. Dad & Mum called, as did few relatives ðŸ™‚ Returned to work on Friday evening(\*grumble\*grumble\*), got wishes from Colleagues, and cake facials ( thankfully, no tomatoes or rotten eggs !). Finished off work and got back home Saturday morning. (FYI: Reach office at 5:30pm, leave at 5:30am).

Saturday afternoon I was supposed to be at the [Indibloggers&#8217; meet in Chennai][6]{#aptureLink_YF0RO3tNEl} but thanks to my working works, I woke up late and couldn&#8217;t make it (almost). Ankit sent me a message about trying to make it to the Indiblogger meet, and after a li&#8217;l coaxing by [Narayanan][7]{#aptureLink_sMuPRGu1nv} I [moved my lazy butt][8]{#aptureLink_Oow44GQeKQ} over to GRT convention centre, at the best time possible (read: Just in time to eat and to grab the T-shirt). Met [Ankit Agarwal][9]{#aptureLink_R7qGBhsXWM} for the first time, after lots of &#8220;yeah we&#8217;ll meet this weekend for sure&#8221; tweets.Â  I will definitely catch up with him. For sure.

From there, [Narayanan][10]{#aptureLink_BwvqI69Wmr}, [Preethika][11]{#aptureLink_yZDh43vk1W}, [Ankit][12]{#aptureLink_JUlxe8gn3w} and me were wondering what to do, thought of heading off to 10 D but it was only 6pm and 10 D wouldn&#8217;t open for another hour or so. Narayanan suggested we try out this new place called [9 feet High][13]{#aptureLink_cpWNhM3ojB} . 9 feet highÂ [was pretty nice][14]{#aptureLink_ZFsC6xXXz2}, beachside view, great ambience, good music and okay-ish food. Tried out &#8220;[Nanu mix][15]{#aptureLink_StWNvLfyCH}&#8221; :pÂ  ( for the curious, its a cocktail mix prepared by Narayanan &#8211; Vodka, green chilles, lime, Sprite &#8211; a very unique combination). Our discussion was interrupted by a, er, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">loafer</span> [very interesting person][16]{#aptureLink_orFefSSvD0}. Needless to say he wasn&#8217;t clearly thinking straight and the poor lady accompanying him was rather embarrassed. (Side note: Narayanan mentioned about him sending an SMS [apologizing his behaviour][17]{#aptureLink_KuclfOrT35}). Moving on, we headed back to IIT-Madras, where we had our fill of food and to end the day, Narayanan dropped us back to our PG. Quite an interesting day it was indeed.
