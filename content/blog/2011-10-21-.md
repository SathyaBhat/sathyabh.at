Well, after about 4 years of being in <a title="All articles tagged Chennai" href="https://sathyabh.at/tag/chennai" target="_blank">Chennai</a> (OK, 3 years since I spent a year in <a title="All articles tagged Austin" href="https://sathyabh.at/tag/austin" target="_blank">Austin</a>) I&#8217;m moved away from Chennai and now closer to my hometown of <a title="All articles tagged Mangalore" href="https://sathyabh.at/tag/mangalore" target="_blank">Mangalore</a>.

Yep, I&#8217;ve moved to <a title="All articles tagged Bangalore" href="https://sathyabh.at/tag/bangalore" target="_blank">Bangalore</a> or Bengalooru/Bengaluru &#8211; whichever is correct. The relocation was kinda surprising  and totally unexpected. My work situation was kinda unique that I was the sole developer in Chennai &#8211; half my team mates are in Bangalore, the remaining half in Helsinki, Finland. Add to the mix that I remote into my workstation in Helsinki. When I moved over to Logica, I had been to Bangalore for about 2 weeks for training and to meet up with my team. Back then, I did raise a request asking them to move me to Bangalore.

The request was rejected citing space concerns. I was kinda disappointed, but I did expect that would be the reply. Unknown to me, my project manager kept raising the requests for relocation and finally it was approved.

Before moving, I had a small meetup with [msnarain][1] and few other Chennai tweeps. Also met up with Shivaranjan and netcitizen. We were supposed to meet at 10 D, but the place was overcrowded for some reason and we shifted to Bikes and Barrels, which was just down the road

![Cheers!][2] 

Had a slight kerfuffle when the guys at Bikes and Barrels decided that it was not ok for @netcitizen to be wearing an sandals after 4pm. Weird that they didn&#8217;t seem to when we were there for over 3 hours and all of a sudden, now that the clock struck 4, their boot-sense was tingled all of a sudden. 

Anyhow, we moved away from there over to a restaurant near Velachery for some evening dosai
