Couple of days ago I&#8217;d posted a small text on my Tumblelog which went like this:

> next couple of days could give me a very important break in my career. Will it happen or wonâ€™tÂ ? Hoping for the former.

That was cryptic, wasn&#8217;t it ? Atleast Reetesh thought so!

So to clear up, did it happen? Did I get the break: the answer is YES! ðŸ˜€Â 

And what&#8217;s the big break? Well, I&#8217;ve been&#8221; identified&#8221; as a technical resourceÂ for onsite implementation of the current project I&#8217;m working on. Quite a mouthful eh? Basically, I will be accompanying the implementor(the functional guy) and lending him assistance with regard to technical issues, data migration etc.

So why was I so cryptic in the first place? And what&#8217;s with &#8220;identified&#8221;, Â you may be wondering huh ? Read on.

<!--more-->Well this happened last week: The onsite implementor comes to me, and asks me to have a talk with me. We have a smoke together and then he asks me, How good are you with the product? I reply, I can handle it, but I have zero knowledge of functional stuff. He was like OK that&#8217;s fine. He then tells me &#8211; you will most probably going onsite as a technical resource. Don&#8217;t discuss this with anyone yet, we&#8217;ll have to get this thing finalized. And couple of days later &#8211; I get an official mail &#8211; &#8220;We&#8217;ve identified Sathyajith for API onsite implementation&#8221;. So&#8230;&#8230; YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ \:D/ \:D/

So the reason why I was so cryptic was because (a) the implementor had told me that I _may_Â be going, he wasn&#8217;t too certain (b) I didn&#8217;t have a passport. So I was like very uncertain if I&#8217;ll miss the opportunity, and I didn&#8217;t want to go about saying Yaay I&#8217;m going onsite and then get blown out at the last moment.Â 

And as for &#8220;identified&#8221; well I wasn&#8217;t the first choice &#8211; there were 4 guys ahead of me, 3 of them rejected the offer as they&#8217;d already put down their papers<sup><a href="#footnote_0_130" id="identifier_0_130" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="resigned">1</a></sup> and the fourth guy said no. So basically I was like the last-ditch choice &#8211; if you must. But meh, don&#8217;t matter. I like challenges &#8211; and this will be a huge one for me.

Past few days I&#8217;ve been pretty busy &#8211; getting the paperwork done (I _still_Â don&#8217;t have a passport- gotta apply for it), fixing existing QC calls and closing ACD points, and tomorrow onwards I&#8217;ll be having KT sessions &#8211; something which will be very vital for me, if I&#8217;ve to perform well. I&#8217;ll be onsite in US, Texas for about 3 months, I guess. And in that time, I really don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be able to blog on My World/Sathya Says /tweet(though tweeting shouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem), Â lets see how it turns out.Â 

Wish me all the best guys!

and yes, if you&#8217;re in college/just completed college, PLEEEEAASE, pleaaaase get your Passport done. Never know when an opportunity will come by you.
