Statuatory Warning: LOT of curse words ahead. If you cant stand curse words, well then fuck you.

[ad]

My stay in Chennai is turning out to be one big lesson as to what kinda pricks and dumb fucks exist in this planet.

First it was the [Chennai][1] [Cops][2]. Then it was the [stupid mansion owner][3].  Recently it was a [stupid hotel cashier][4]. Chalk up yet another dumb prick to that list courtesy yesterday night&#8217;s sequence of events.  As usual, after doing some last minute mail checking, I went to sleep at around 01:45. Barely half hour later, we had a power failure. No fans, 40 degree temperature, >90% humidity, sweat pouring down your head and neck, I was certainly NOT in the best of my mood. And then, bam! Some stupid prick prick starts playing music from his (presumably Walkman series, going by the loudness)phone AT FULL VOLUME,  at 02:30. I mean WTF? I gave him a bit of time, waited for couple of songs to get over, thinking he would stop playing.

<!--more-->

[ad]

it. But noooo, he HAD to continue. I was controlling myself, counting to ten, trying not to get angry. But when that prick continued playing, I jsut lost my cool, and yelled at the top of my voice, &#8220;Abbe Idiot music player bandh kar!&#8221;, TWICE. Immediately, he shuts down the player. And then, 5 mins of silence. And then, he starts ranting like a madman. &#8220;Come to my room. Show your face. I&#8217;ll screw your ass! I&#8217;ll screw your happiness&#8221; <curses more in Tamil>. Starts playing the music again, at a Low volume for 30 seconds, stops it, and then starts barking &#8220;Show your face! Come to my Room, #308. Complain to the manager. This isnt your apartment&#8221;. He&#8217;s barking all this, I&#8217;m still going WTF, how retarded is this asshole.

And then he says this final piece of shit dialog which made me go 8-|

[like a whining little kid]&#8221;I wanna listen to music&#8221;, &#8220;I wanna listen to music&#8221;

LISTEN YOU DUMB PRICK,IF YOU WANNA LISTEN TO MUSIC, DO IT AT MORNINGS OR EVENINGS, **NOT WHEN THE ENTIRE WORLD IS SLEEPING, FAGGOT**. YOU WANNA DO THAT DURING NIGHT TIME, USE A FUCKING EARPHONE.

_IF you can&#8217;t afford that, here&#8217;s **[Fifty Paise][5].** Go grab them and stuff them in your ears_.  
RETARDS.
