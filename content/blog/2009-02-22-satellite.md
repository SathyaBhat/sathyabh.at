> Satellite
> 
> Soon a man will kneel to pray  
> Soon the light will burn our shade  
> And with the sweet the bitter fades  
> So my heart and take your place
> 
> Cause I will be your force  
> And I will be your right  
> And I will watch over you like a satellite
> 
> Soon reason will have rhyme  
> Soon wisdom will imply  
> And with courage doubt subsides  
> So take my heart and take my pride
> 
> And I will be your side  
> And I will be your might  
> And I will watch over you like a satellite
> 
> River will flow from scenes unknown  
> I&#8217;ll guide you through by the love I&#8217;ll show  
> And the stars will wish upon the night  
> That they could have a guiding satellite 

Beautiful song.
