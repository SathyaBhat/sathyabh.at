&#8220;Black Friday&#8221; in US is the day after Thanksgiving day. On this single day you get the best deals &#8211; flat discounts, and unbelievable prices. There&#8217;s a catch though, the best deals are available real early &#8211; I mean as early 5 AM &#8211; people are known to camp the night out just to grab them. While my colleague and me went to the mall relatively late at 7:30 I still got some nice deals.

Picked up this PSP for $150 after tax.

I was also looking for a WiFi router, as the Internet guys put a basic cable modem with really short wires, and me with multiple laptops I was finding it difficult on a wired connectiion, but couldn&#8217;t find any good deals.Following day I went to Fry&#8217;s (oh BTW visit to Fry&#8217;s will cause an orgasm for any geek \*\*DROOOL\*\* ) and to my luck I found some SUPER FRIGGIN&#8217; AWESOME deals. First I spotted a Seagate FreeAgent 500GB external drive for $119 &#8211; I thought that was grand, but then, just further down spotted another Kickass deal &#8211; a 750 GB SimpleTech pininifarina USB external drive for Frikkin&#8217; $90. YOU BELIEVE THAT!! The drive looks AWESOME (pics below) and drive performance is pretty good too.

To make things sweeter, I also picked up a Netgear WGT 624 for $26.

The ever popular WRT54G was on sale for $10 (No KIDDING!! but unfortunately it had been sold out :(( Nevertheless think I did some mighty good shopping eh ðŸ˜€

Since I didn&#8217;t have a credit card(well I do, but thats linked to my Indian bank account) I didn&#8217;t purchase anything on Cyber Monday &#8211; thats the Monday coming up after Black Friday . Cyber Monday is called so because of an overwhelming amount of purchases & deals are done and are available online on various sites.

Oh well I&#8217;m happy ðŸ˜€
