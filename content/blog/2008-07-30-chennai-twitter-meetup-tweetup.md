It seems with twitter everything happens instantaneously. You get instant feedback, instant replies, instant responses. And the next Chennai twitter meet was decided instantaneously.

I was talking to <a href="https://thecruisemaniac.com/" target="_blank">Ashwin</a> aka <a href="https://twitter.com/cruisemaniac" target="_blank">cruisemaniac</a> regarding his day day in Italy, and he asked if I’m in Chennai. I responded in positive, and he told me he’ll be landing here and will be here till Saturday and bam! Next thing we know we decided to meetup this Saturday, and extend the invitation to fellow Chennai twitter users.

Here’s the details:

Date: Saturday, August 2nd 2008. Time: Around 13:00-13:30

Venue: Not decided yet, most probably Resto Bronx bar at Hotel Manhattan, Santhome.

I&#8217;m open to any other suggestions.

If you&#8217;re interested in coming, drop a comment or send me a @[reply on twitter][1]. Hope to see you there!
