  Yup, what was tentative earlier is now more or less confirmed as the below picture shows:<br /> <img class="aligncenter" src="http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/688/defleppard2300x225ag3.jpg" alt="Def Leppard!" />

  I _should_ be able to make it, and if I do, this will be the first concert I&#8217;ll be attending! I desperately wanted Red Hot Chili Peppers to perform live(there were rumours of them performing in Bangalore), sadly seems the concert didn&#8217;t materialize. Oh well. Santosh & Subbu have confirmed their presence for the concert, are you coming? Confirm your presence over at <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/583424">last.fm events</a>.
