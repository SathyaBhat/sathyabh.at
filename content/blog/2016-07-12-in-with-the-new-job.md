July has been aÂ month of great changes.. I started my first job in July in Chennai - Â new city, staying on my own, earning my own money.. but that was about 9 years back.

This year again, July is a month of change. <a href="https://sathyabh.at/2011/04/22/goodbye-3i/" target="_blank">After 5 years</a>(and few days) at CGI(<a href="https://www.cgi.com/en/CGI-completes-Logica-acquisition-new-leadership-team" target="_blank">erstwhile</a> Logica), I will be moving away and onto the new unknown. Reasons for moving are many -Â completed myÂ project, didn't like the new project's commute/timings, tech stagnation and personal growth are some of the major ones. Where to next, you might ask?

Well after all these years of corporate life, time for something new - will be joining <a href="https://styletag.com" target="_blank">Styletag.com</a>Â as the DevOps guy. From Oracle to Rails, on-premise to AWS, this is something that will be a challenge I am sure, and I look forward to it.

Wish me best wishes ðŸ˜‰
