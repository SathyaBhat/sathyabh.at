Its been a while since I&#8217;ve posted (crap nearly a month) on my blog &#8211; so what have I been upto and what&#8217;s happening ?  
For starters, work, work, work, more work &#8211; did I mention work ? There&#8217;s just 2 people here in Austin for the project I&#8217;m with and as we hit the project go live date, there&#8217;s tons of work to be doing &#8211; and the 2 of us are just about struggling. My colleague being the Business Analyst & Implementer -means that he&#8217;s got to report to his managers about what&#8217;s going on and and analysis of bug reports, calls resolved etc. That leaves him busy &#8211; and leaves me with a frikkin&#8217; huge set of things to do &#8211; test the test conditions in advance and report any bugs found.

<!--more-->

That&#8217;s just a start &#8211; a day prior to the actual testing, I have to setup the required data and conditions &#8211; that means setting up multiple policies, associated claims et al. Then there&#8217;s filing in of bugs as reported by the client, data migration and data migration testing, preparing training manuals, assisting the users in getting a hang of the application.

To make things worse the business users doing the testing are free only at mornings from 7 -8 that means I&#8217;ve to leave my place at 6:30. Though I reach back by about 5:30 or 6, there&#8217;d be lot of leftover work which keeps me occupied till 8-8:30pm, after which I prepare dinner and then (generally) calls from Chennai, or someother work which means I get to sleep by only 12:00 or 1. \*phew\*!

Work aside, well there&#8217;s nothing much happening &#8211; like I said been too engrossed in work. My I-94 expired on Feb 20 &#8211; and an extension has been filed &#8211; I&#8217;d probably be in Austin till April, even beyond that, maybe. That depends on coming weeks ahead, which are pretty critical.

It just struck me that I&#8217;ve been in Austin for 3 monthsÂ  &#8211; quarter of a year. Hard to believe &#8211; time has flown by so fast. And soon as I left Chennai all the interesting things magically happened &#8211; couple of tweetups(read up about them here &#8211; a little mini project by Narayanan, Ashish and Me) , tweople featured on media, Foodwalk, RTFF [Rooftop Film Festival] etc. How much do you want to bet on the fact that I moment I reach back nothing interesting would be there?

The other thing I&#8217;m going to miss terribly is Barcamp Bangalore 8 &#8211; BCB7 was the first Barcamp I&#8217;d been to &#8211; and I met all the fantastic people &#8211; Ashwin, Daaku [yes I know his real name, nobody would recognise if I mention it ðŸ˜› ], Arun, Saurabh, Suksy, Prashanth, Ashish, Laxman, Santosh, Viral &#8211; and \*so\* many other awesome peopleÂ  &#8211; damn I&#8217;m gonna miss not being there!

The good thing is that Barcamp Austin 4 will be on March 13-15, about the same time as SXSW. I \*hope\* I can attend either (preferably both) these events.

Another little thing &#8211; being I&#8217;ve \*actually\* learn to cook. Something which I never thought I&#8217;d do in a million years.

And yes finally &#8211; I guess I can make this statement &#8211; &#8220;official&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;ve quit smoking. I&#8217;d been smoking at almost 1 pack(10 cigs) a day, overtime I reduced it to 8, 5 &#8211; but still couldn&#8217;t give it up totally. Have been smoke free for 3 months now &#8211; haven&#8217;t smoked after coming to US . Something to feel good about ðŸ™‚ guess Manan&#8217;s post made me go towards it. I suppose that&#8217;s about it for now &#8211; gotta get up early tomorrow (as usual). More posts soon, I hope.
