I had tweeted these 2 simple sentences, the former about 3 months ago, the latter yesterday. Yep, after nearly 4 years, I'm moving away from 3i. It's been an interesting experience - I've ranted and raved about my journeys on twitter, and often blogged about my [experiences and misadventures in 3i](https://sathyabh.at/tags/3i/) (if you have same free time, go read through the archives - good stories there). In these past (almost-)4 years, I started out as a trainee, creating patches & shipments, moved onto to GUI development using Oracle forms, switched over to backend stored procedures development using PL/SQL. Then came the big challenges - client interaction & data migration. Moving data from a 30-year old legacy system is no easy task, and with the constraints & adherence to business logic to be followed - was no doubt, the most challenging task that I had undertaken. Big props to all my colleagues, team mates, peers who helped me along and encouraged and motivated me. Also, a special Thank You to the Ruby gang

So what's next? I will be moving over to [Logica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logica), starting Monday. I'll still be in Chennai, though. Â Here's for the new challenge ahead.
