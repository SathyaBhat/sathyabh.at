I've finally done it. Been contemplating it for a while, but past couple of days' turn of events have made me do what I've been contemplating about. What am I writing about? My tumblelog of course!

I get lots, I mean LOTS of email forwards. Those subscribed to my forwards mailing list would say I send lots of forwards. But then I forward only the best of the lot, and that's like maybe 10% of what I get. But then couple of days ago, my office NT user account (and not just mail account) was disabled by the mail network admin, citing "Mail misuse" 😐 After running from pillar to post, getting approval mails from group head, phone calls to the network admin, apologizing and three-quarters of a day lost productivity, was finally able to get my NT account re-enabled, and me decided not forward anymore. But still I wanted to share those forwards. I've been trying WordPress's blog-by-email feature, but was unable to get it running on my Google Apps' mail id. 

Tumblr seemed a nice way of sharing these forwards, and though I'd signed up for tumblr couple of weeks back, I'd never used it. So I decided to wipe off the dust, and launch it! The result -> Ta daah! [Sathya's Tumbles][1] (yeah I know corny name, but WTH). I'm still waiting for the A records propogation to be through, and once that is done, my tumblelog will be available at <https://tumble.sathyabh.at/>. I've also enabled Disqus comments for my Tumblelog, so feel free to comment 🙂 [on a side note, I'm seriously considering integrating Disqus with my WordPress blogs]. There's also a "read-only" mode of my tumblelog at <https://sathyabh.at/tumblelog> which just displays my tumblelog posts, adapting my blog CSS, which looks neat 😀

Next - Barcamp Bangalore 7 is here! Though I won't be able to attend day 1 of Barcamp Bangalore due to clash with my working days, I will be there for day 2. I'm really excited to attend, since this will be the first ever Barcamp that I'm gonna attend. I've signed up as Volunteer over there, will be blogging and obviosuly tweeting about it as well. Looking forward to meeting Santosh(@9_6), Laxman(@scorpion032), Ashwin(@cruisemaniac), Prashanth(@hnprashanth), Ashish(@mataal) and LOT more of tweeters! So see you all there! 

And just as I was about to leave from office, I was chatting with [Kunal Sheth][2] over GTalk and he told me that he's going to be in Bangalore on Monday, so that just about about made my day - I do hope Kunal can spare some time and we could catchup - it'll be awesome if we could.

So then see ya all in Barcamp!
