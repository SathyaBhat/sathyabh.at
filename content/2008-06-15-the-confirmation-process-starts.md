Most of you must be knowing that I’ve been working at <a href="https://www.3i-infotech.com/" target="_blank">3i Infotech</a> for about 11 months now. Yup 11 months – that’s how long I’ve been in Chennai – can’t believe, but I’ll save that post for later. As per the 3i’s joining conditions, I would be a trainee for a minimum of a year, though the trainee period maybe extended. The good news is that few days ago I got a mail asking me to fill in details about my reporting authority – i.e., whom I report to, the project name, former projects etc.

So I guess this is one-step towards my confirmation. So far I’ve been a trainee, earning stipend. Once I’m confirmed as an employee, I’ll be getting PF, HRA, medical allowance, and yes a salary hike too. So I’m hoping that the confirmation thingy goes well. I’ll keep you guys updated on this.
