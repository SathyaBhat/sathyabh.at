### Summary

What a monumental year. 2025 was a year of incredible highs and intense periods of focus. We traveled extensively for work and leisure, with trips to Denver, San Francisco, Seattle, Hunter Valley, and Amsterdam. The concert-going streak continued with some truly epic shows. My fitness journey, which started last year, became a consistent part of my life, hitting milestones I never thought possible. But two events stand out above all others: in August, we were granted Australian Permanent Residence, a huge weight off our shoulders. And after a stressful house-hunting period, we capped off the year by buying our very first home in Sydney. It’s been a whirlwind, and I’m filled with gratitude. Our weekly Discord calls with the gang continued, providing a steady anchor through all the craziness.

### By the months

Here’s a breakdown of how the year unfolded:

**January:** The year kicked off with a family health situation back in Mangalore, which thankfully resolved well. The trip involved a lot of city driving and rediscovering some iconic local eateries. Back in Sydney, I immediately flew out to Denver for The Trade Desk's annual [Palooza event](/weekly-notes-03-2025/). It was a great trip, featuring a visit to the surreal Meow Wolf exhibit and meeting colleagues, but it was freezing! I also got back into my gym routine.

**February:** We kicked off our concert-going for the year with a free String Quartet performance at the Art Gallery of NSW. Our guitar classes started up again, and we did the scenic Sydney Harbour Bridge walk. It was a big month for gaming with the release of Civilization VII, which consumed many of my weekends. In a new turn of events, I also took on the Scrum Master role for my team at work.

**March:** My 40th birthday month! Jo planned a fantastic day, culminating in watching [MJ: The Musical](/weekly-notes-12-2025/). The month was packed with live music: Stone Temple Pilots with Wolfmother, King Stingray, and the Race of Champions motorsport event. I also upgraded my coffee setup at home with a Breville Bambino Plus. A minor disaster with my home server setup served as a reminder to always have backups.

**April:** Another huge month for concerts. We saw the legendary Andrea Bocelli at the SCG, and the phenomenal Hans Zimmer, whose live performance of the Interstellar soundtrack was a core memory. We said a sad farewell to our wonderful guitar instructor, Luis. For the Easter long weekend, we took a memorable road trip to Canberra, and on Anzac Day, we did a day trip to the beautiful [Northern Beaches](/northern-beaches-day-trip/).

**May:** The weather turned cold and we watched our first live AFL "footy" match at the SCG, which was a fantastic experience. I celebrated my 50th workout session at the gym, a milestone that felt great. The house hunt began to ramp up, and we started spending weekends at open-house inspections.

**June:** Winter truly set in. I stepped up my fitness game by joining group cross-fit classes and hit a new deadlift personal best of 80kg. A highlight was a day trip to Kiama, exploring the coastline and the famous blowhole. My school friend announced his wedding in Amsterdam, and the visa application process began.

**July:** We celebrated three years of living in Sydney! The month was marked by work events, including a fun winter party at Hijinx Hotel. I also got my old work desktop as part of a hardware refresh and began setting it up as a proper home server. We spent our Sunday mornings exploring local walking trails like the one at Berry Island Reserve.

**August:** A month of massive news and travel! We kicked it off with a trip to Hunter Valley for Jo's birthday, though the weather turned it into a cozy staycation. In the gym, I hit a huge milestone: a 100kg deadlift. Then I was off to the US for two weeks, first to San Francisco for a team meetup, where I tried a Waymo for the first time and saw Dave Matthews Band live. Then, I flew to Seattle for the AWS Hero Summit. While there, I received the incredible news that **our Australian Permanent Residence had been granted!**

**September:** Back in Sydney, the first order of business was getting my Schengen visa, which was approved just in time. I then flew to Amsterdam for my best friend Raylen's wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony and a fantastic opportunity to reconnect with school friends after two decades. Back home, we attended an amazing John Butler concert.

**October:** Returning from my Amsterdam vacation, it was a relaxed re-entry with a Lucky Ali concert at the Sydney Opera House. The house hunt heated up significantly. We made our first offer on a property and attended our first-ever auction, where we were outbid. I also celebrated one full year of consistent strength training, having lost around 18kg and feeling fitter than ever.

**November:** The house hunt reached its climax. After observing another auction where the house we liked was passed in, we entered into a stressful negotiation process. And then, it happened - **we bought a house!** It’s an incredible feeling to finally have a place to call our own. We celebrated this massive milestone by attending a spectacular Metallica concert, with Evanescence supporting. A fittingly epic end to a stressful but rewarding month.

**December:** *(Predicted)* With the house secured, we’re looking forward to a relaxed December. We'll be focusing on planning the move for next year, enjoying the Sydney summer, and welcoming the new year from our own home (well, soon-to-be home!).

### What’s for 2026?

With the two huge goals of PR and a house achieved, 2026 will be about settling in. The big project will be moving into our new home and making it ours. I also need to finally get my Australian driver's license. I want to continue my fitness journey, explore more of our new neighborhood, and perhaps do some local travel. And of course, keep writing, gaming, and enjoying live music.

Wishing you all a wonderful and fulfilling 2026!
