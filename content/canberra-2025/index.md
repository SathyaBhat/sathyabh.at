We had a Friday off thanks to Anzac Day. Jo & I went on a short walk around the block. The weather was nice and Jo quipped it would be really nice day to head to the beach. Since we had nothing to do and our usual GoGet car (a Toyota RAV4) was available, we booked the car. We were still in our work out clothes and had head back home, so we walked over to the car, drove it to home and parked the car. 

A quick trip to our house, we changed our clothes, put some screen on, filled up our water bottles, stuffed some protein bars, picnic blanket and the other essentials like powerbank, cameras and started towards the Northern Beaches.
