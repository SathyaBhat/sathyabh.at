Yup, this upcoming week will be my last week in India. I'd mentioned earlier about me <a rel="external" href="https://sathyabh.at/2008/09/21/onsite-opportunity-beckons/">getting an onsite gig.</a> This week will probably be the last week here in India, before I fly off to Austin, Texas. I still have my Visa interview due this Wednesday, November 12th though. Earlier today I'd come to know that the most probable date for mr flying would be November 16th, but then it was pushed to November 19th to give some buffer time incase my visa gets delayed and all. Don't know if I'll be able to head back home, I'll try to squeeze in a Mangalore trip this weekend, but I'm afraid most likely that ain't gonna happen and I'd have to fly directly from Chennai. 

Well thats about all I can think of now. Will post on my visa interview experiences once its over on Wednesday. For quick updates you can always [follow me][1] on twitter.
