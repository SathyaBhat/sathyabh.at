Past couple of weeks have been sort of "important" for most people in 3i. Reason being: appraisal time. It's that time of the year, where you are judged and rated for your performances. It's a 3-tier appraisal, the immediate appraiser being the project manager, then the group head, and finally the HR. Appraisal mean everything for most - whether you get promoted/demoted, whether you get a salary hike or not. 

In case you guys are wondering why I've mentioned in the first line "for most people", well it's because, me being a Trainee, an appraisal for me holds no weightage, monetory wise. The monetory increase will come, once I'm confirmed, ie, at the end of my training period, which will happen in July. Well my appraisal meeting with my manager went very well, he was pretty happy with my performance, and amongst the things he'd said was "I can assign you some work, and not be bothered on following it up with you as I know you will complete it". That's given me an immense boot to my confidence, and it's made me feel good. And to top, my overall rating is a 3.9/5, which is pretty good. So the next thing to watch out for would be my confirmation, which should happen in July. Will keep you guys updated.

Cheers
