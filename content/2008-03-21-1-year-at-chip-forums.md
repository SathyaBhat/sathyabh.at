Today I completed an anniversary of sorts - [1 year][1] of registering at [Chip India forums][2]. Chip was the first site I visited soon as I got my BSNL broadband connection(yeah, a year ago), and was instantly hooked on, esp with "friendliness quotient" factor of the forums. I was on "lurk" state for a few days, and was overwhelmed - by the amount of knowledge these guys at forums had. Initially I couldn't post a reply to many topics - since I didn't know much about them, at all, although exception was anything regarding Linux, since I've been a Linux user for a bit, but then posts on Linux were few and far between. Nevertheless, it's been a very fruitful, daunting, learning experience.

Over the this period, I've made quite a lot of friends. In-fact, [Sathya Says][3] wouldn't be in existence if it wasn't for Chip, as I'd come to know [Preshit][4] over there - Preshit's now a good friend of mine, pro-blogger, web maniac, twitter & flickr buff, and of course, my site host - [ExperTrio][5]. Preshit's been a huge influence on me, especially with the way I see the Internet now. Of course there are other guys at Chip, who've helped me a lot, but Preshit's influence is something different altogether. I'm also a registered user at Digit forums, a [Moderator][6] at [Tech2.0 forums][7], but Chip remains Chip.

Thanks to all for making this stay worthwhile and an extremely pleasant experience.
