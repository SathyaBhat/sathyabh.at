### What's been happening

* It was Jo's birthday this week. I asked a team mate for some suggestions to a restaurant and she told me couple of choices. I picked an Italian restaurant (called [Sagra](https://www.sydneysagra.com.au/)) because we've been trying to find a decent Italian place and most have been pretty meh. Thankfully, this place was really good. It was a small, quaint little place. The service was a bit slow [but the food](https://pxl.mx/p/sathyabhat/594532211850375235/) was great. While walking to the place, we realized there's a whole lot of Italian restaurants on the same road as this restaurant. We should be back to the area to explore more such restaurants.

* Ever since our electricity meter got upgraded to [a digital meter](/2023/07/16/weekly-notes-28-2023/) I've been thinking of a way to export the data to a timeseries database so I can chart out my usage. I realized that my energy provider's website has an option to download the usage data from the past two years.  Over the past week, I wrote a script to read this file and import the data to a timeseries database. I'm trying to figure out if I can make it more automated. I'll publish the code to my Github as well, but for now there's a lot of magic numbers that need to be cleaned up. Look for a blog post on my [tech blog soon](https://sathyasays.com).

* I bought [Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/). The character creator/customizer is quite comprehensive! I've started a [Tiefling](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tiefling) [Monk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Monk?so=search). For a change I didn't start a game with my usual Fire mage archetype but I figured let's try something else for a change.

* I went to the Sydney Serverless meetup. I'm slowly beginning to meet and recognize some of the familiar faces. It was nice to meet fellow Hero [Peter Hanssens](https://www.peterhanssens.com.au/) who runs the Serverless Meetup and is also organizng the DataEngBytes Conference, happening on [August 25th](https://dataengconf.com.au/conference/sydney/). 

* I found out about [Stewardle](https://stewardle.com/), which is Wordle but for Formula 1 enthusiasts. Give it a try if you want to test your F1 knowledge.
