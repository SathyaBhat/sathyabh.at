while surfing through [Chennai telephones](https://chennai.bsnl.co.in) site, I came across an interesting web page: [https://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO.htm][1] This is indeed good news for me, and for those people who can't just go for a wired connection now(read my reason as to why i cant get a wired connection [here](https://sathyabh.at/2008/01/19/my-laptop-chronicles-obtainingor-trying-to-obtain-a-bsnl-evdo-connection-part-1/). While a web page announcement is a good thing, whether it'll change the ground reality - that of lack on information among BSNl employees about EVDo, anytime soon will remain to be seen. I've [previously](https://sathyabh.at/2008/01/19/my-laptop-chronicles-obtainingor-trying-to-obtain-a-bsnl-evdo-connection-part-1/) [blogged](https://sathyabh.at/2008/02/17/of-handling-multiple-projects-and-failed-evdo-connections/) about my hassles in trying to obtain *information* about an EVDO connection. Let's hope this time around I get better news and feedback. I will keep you guys informed about happenings as and when I get the latest updates
