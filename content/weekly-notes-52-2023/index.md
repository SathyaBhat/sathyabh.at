It's the last week of the year 2023. When I started writing my weekly notes back in [January](/2023/01/21/weekly-notes-03-2023/), I wanted to make a habit of writing them, but didn't think I'd write 49 editions of the weekly notes. Here we are now. In many ways, the weekly notes have been a good way to reminisce about what Jo and I did the past week, and these notes made it easy to compile my look back at the [2023 post](/a-look-back-at-2023/). Most of us do a lot of what seems to be insignificant things, I have found writing about them makes you realize they aren't that insignificant and add up quite a bit. Here's to more writing!

### What's been happening

* I enrolled in a sleep study to check for possible sleep apnea. The sleep study involved me sleeping overnight with a sleep-measuring device. The device collects a lot of data about respiratory rate, Oxygen levels, airflow levels etc overnight. The hardest part was setting up the device as there are a lot of electrodes to be attached and having to carry the device which is quite bulky as it is battery-backed. I won't know the results of the study till much later, but that sleep with the device was one of the worst quality sleeps that I've ever had, and I wonder how much that would skew the results.

* We walked over to the Sydney Observatory to catch the sunset from one of the vantage points. It was pretty crowded but well worth the walk!

* I did end up buying Dave the Diver. It's been a nice game, plenty of laughs and gags. Not quite what I'd call cozy though - the aggressive fishes can be quite annoying especially since you can only target at a 60-degree arc on each side. The restaurant management seems to get a bit better to handle once you hire more people. I look forward to playing the game more.

* Finally, we welcomed the New Year's at home, having a couple of beers. Initially, we planned to head out to Darling Harbour to check out the 9 pm fireworks show but by 7 pm itself notices were being posted about the vantage points being at capacity, so we decided to remain at home and watch the fireworks show. 


### Music of the Week

What else but [Auld Lang Syne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne) to welcome the New Year?
